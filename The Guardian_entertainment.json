        "content": "10. Neil Gaiman and FourPlay String Quartet \u2013 Signs of Life Sydney-based string quartet FourPlay have made a name by playing versions of music by various rock and jazz artists, including Radiohead and Metallica, but they have also been working with the fantasy writer Neil Gaiman for more than a decade. Here they provide a series of wonderfully quizzical, meandering accompaniments as Gaiman recites deeply humanistic prose and poetry about truth, lies, death, Joan of Arc and the \u201ccasual genocide\u201d of Indigenous Australians. His verses can be horrific, mini-horror movies, like The Wreckers, or amusingly whimsical and Ivor Cutler-ish, like M\u00f6bius Strip. 9. Joel Styzens \u2013 Resonance Chicago multi-instrumentalist and composer Styzens plays hammered dulcimer and classical guitar in this unorthodox outfit which also features Illinois jazz pianist Rob Clearfield, British cellist Sophie Webber and the Atlys String Quartet. You would broadly describe the music they make as minimalism, but where so much minimalism can be insistent, grating and aggravating, this is a form that does not play mathematical games or create fractal patterns \u2013 it is lush, comforting music that yearns and soothes. Unorthodox \u2026 Joel Styzens. Photograph: Sarah Boudreau 8. Thomas Ad\u00e8s/Los Angeles Philharmonic \u2013 Dante To accompany Wayne McGregor\u2019s ballet production of Dante\u2019s The Divine Comedy, the British composer Thomas Ad\u00e8s devised this incredibly ambitious piece in three movements. The first, Inferno, is a bombastic tone poem that lurches between horror-movie modernism and nods to Liszt and Berlioz. The woozier second section, Purgatoria, sets Middle Eastern musical tropes against distorted recordings of singers from Jerusalem\u2019s Great Ades Synagogue (a place distantly related to Ad\u00e8s\u2019s Syrian Jewish ancestors). The finale, Paradisol, is an ecstatic, spiralling, slurring piece of 12-tone serialism. These are pastiches, yes, but brilliantly done. 7. Anna Meredith and Ligeti Quartet \u2013 Nuc Tuggemo, the opening track on this collaboration between the Scottish composer and the London-based string quartet, is a conscious nod to rave culture, something often near the surface with Meredith\u2019s music. But the most interesting tracks here push the string section to its limits: the microtonality of Honeyed Words, the shimmering irradiance of Chorale, or the wonderfully demented minimalism of Shill. The Ligeti also revive Meredith\u2019s 2013 composition A Short Tribute to Teenage Fanclub, which doesn\u2019t seem to quote the Glasgow janglers at all but which features a series of downward scales that become increasingly, and joyously, shambolic as the piece progresses. Chaos \u2026 Ligeti Quartet. Photograph: Louise Mason 6. Galya Bisengalieva \u2013 Polygon London-based Bisengalieva is best known as the lead violinist in Robert Ames\u2019s London Contemporary Orchestra and for her work with Radiohead\u2019s Jonny Greenwood and Thom Yorke. Here, on her second LP as a composer and leader, she turns to the grim story of a facility in her native Kazakhstan, where the Soviet military tested hundreds of nuclear weapons, poisoning the population and destroying the ecology. Like Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir\u2019s soundtrack to Chernobyl, it recreates echoey chambers and the sound of geiger counters, but Bisengalieva envelopes these tracks with string arrangements that are both lush and terrifying. 5. Naoko Sakata \u2013 Infinity Born in Japan and based in Gothenburg, Sweden, pianist Sakata plays with a striking fierceness and energy. This album of improvisations, apparently guided by tarot and numerology, melds dozens of different styles. She moves from bowel-quaking low-end rumbles to glistening high-end flourishes; from hymnal, rubato-heavy, Keith Jarrett-like ruminations to Conlan Nancarrow-ish jabbering; from Cecil Taylor freakouts to moments of utter precision. It\u2019s released on Pomperipossa, a label run by the organist Anna von Hausswolff, and Sakata shares Von Hausswolff\u2019s sense of the gothic, but this is truly idiosyncratic music. 4. Lisel \u2013 Patterns for Auto-Tuned Voices and Delay The American singer Eliza Bagg, AKA Lisel, has constructed a piece of chamber music for the human voice, multitracked and fed through myriad effects units. It is haunting and beautiful, from the Dada-esque babble of One at a Time to the Gregorian chant-goes-Dilla minimalism of Plainsong; from the disquieting Wicker Man chant of Immature to the full-throated holler of Stalactite, where her voice starts to shimmer and sparkle. Lisel\u2019s music also raises fundamental questions: once a voice has been treated digitally, is it still human, or a freakish cyborg simulacrum? Read the full review Haunting \u2026 Lisel. Photograph: Tonje Thielson 3. Matthew Halsall \u2013 An Ever Changing View Over nine albums, Halsall has made his name as Manchester\u2019s answer to Sun Ra, his spiritual jazz melding ecstatic freakouts, swirling harps, modal piano flourishes and exotic instrumentation, all melded by Halsall\u2019s Don Cherry-style trumpet. Here he retreats to rural north Wales and moves in a more consciously meditative, bucolic direction. The Alice Coltrane-ish harps have been replaced by thumb pianos and assorted tuned percussion \u2013 glockenspiels, marimbas, triangles, bells \u2013 all woven together with piano, Fender Rhodes, ruminative flute and sax solos and recordings of birdsong to create an ethereal piece of chamber music. Read the full review Miguel Atwood-Ferguson on his giant 50-song album: \u2018I wanted to approach it like an experiment\u2019 Read more 2. Wild Up \u2013 Julius Eastman Vol 3: If You\u2019re So Smart, Why Aren\u2019t You Rich The music of the Black, gay, impish and provocative American composer Julius Eastman has been far more appreciated in the decades since his death 33 years ago. The sonically omnivorous LA collective Wild Up have been painstakingly recreating his compositions in an ongoing series of albums since 2021, assembling arrangements from fragments of recordings and scraps of surviving scores. The 20-minute title track contains a series of rising and falling chromatic scales that are slowly ripped apart; The Moon\u2019s Silent Modulation is an episodic piece of surrealism, complete with operatic harmonies and discordant pianos. Best of all is the sensual, jabbering, high-intensity, maximal minimalism of the unsettling Evil N****r. Urgent and compelling music that seems to have finally found its time. Read the full review 1. Miguel Atwood-Ferguson \u2013 Les Jardins Mystiques Vol 1 One of the most important musicians working in the US, California\u2019s Miguel Atwood-Ferguson has worked on more than 600 albums, arranging, composing, conducting or playing violin, viola or cello with the likes of Ray Charles, Seu Jorge, Mary J Blige, Flying Lotus and the percussionist Carlos Gabriel Ni\u00f1o. This is his debut as leader, drawn from sessions he\u2019s recorded over the last decade, and it\u2019s an absolute epic \u2013 a three-and-a-half-hour triple LP that takes us through glistening Romantic-era impressionism, minimalism, orientalism, John Coltrane-ish modal musings, Alice Coltrane-ish harp-heavy mysticism and even synthesised soundscapes that sound like Bach recreated for an 8-bit video game. A masterpiece.",

I\u2019ve done most of that, including taking an overnight Christmas Eve ferry to get us where we needed to be for Christmas morning (the onboard buffet was surprisingly festive).

The only surprising thing about that for me is how low that is; I\u2019d be willing to bet the subsequent years of pandemic and cost-of-living anxieties have increased our festive stress. I\u2019ve pared Christmas down to the bits I want So here\u2019s a suggestion: have you considered doing less? Or even nothing? That\u2019s my Christmas. We\u2019re going rogue this year with a trip to see our elder son who is working in the US, but in recent years, my 25 Decembers have morphed into a tranquil, low-key, stay-at-home nonevent. I have a lie-in (at 19 and 21, my sons no longer rise at 5am, or even 10am), a coffee and a potter. I exchange desultory WhatsApps with my best friend, who also does nothing for Christmas, about what snacks we\u2019re looking forward to, read by the fire, then eventually consider whether it\u2019s time for a bagel and a glass of champagne. When the kids emerge, they open a couple of presents (it depends on the year whether they\u2019ve remembered to get us anything; we don\u2019t care if they haven\u2019t). We eventually eat, but it isn\u2019t a big event: I usually do something very easy and non-traditional \u2013 one year curry; another tacos \u2013 and with our various dietary foibles, we probably won\u2019t even eat the same thing. We always watch a ton of TV, of course. It\u2019s an exhalation of a time; a moment of heavenly peace. The run-up is similarly calm. Honestly, my only moment of preparatory Christmas anxiety comes at the start of December when I spend a few hours agonising over which panettone to buy, a decision I imbue with disproportionate significance given that most panettone taste identical. Apart from that, preparations are limited to nonexistent. We used to have a potted Christmas tree we rescued from B&Q car park one Christmas Eve, but the drought killed it and even though I do actually love baubles, I don\u2019t know whether we\u2019ll get another: more likely I\u2019ll stick my favourite decorations on the dresser with a string of lights and a couple of bits of holly and call it a day. I delete the Ocado emails about booking slots instantly and refuse to give in to the collective food shopping psychosis that blinds us to the fact that the shops close for only one day, guys \u2013 24 hours! If that! The corner shop is probably open if you\u2019re desperate! And even if it\u2019s not, is it really going to be a disaster if you run out of anything except loo roll? There\u2019s no household cleaning to be done, because no one is coming over \u2013 well, my stepfather and sister and one of my good friends might drop in at some point for a cup of tea or a drink, but they\u2019re all in that category of people you don\u2019t need to make an effort for. Friends might drop in, but they\u2019re all in that category of people you don\u2019t need to make an effort for Presents? Yeah, not really. It\u2019s partly planetary guilt \u2013 a queasy sense that I have no business buying more stuff \u2013 and the cost of living doesn\u2019t help: in a recent survey one in three British adults said they\u2019d be cutting back on spending this year. It\u2019s also about my phase of life: my kids\u2019 generation of the family are all grown up and don\u2019t really need much fuss, while our parents are all deep into their Swedish death cleaning , busily shedding their possessions, not accumulating. My stepfather looks genuinely upset when someone gives him a gift and cannot know peace until he\u2019s regifted it; he turned up hopefully trying to palm off a box of chocolates on me only last week. I\u2019ll get a few bits for my sons, though they\u2019d both much rather I just gave them cash, and I think this might even be the year I stop giving the youngest his traditional \u201cExtraordinary Chickens\u201d calendar: he\u2019s been at university for the past two years and inexplicably left it behind. My husband and I stopped giving each other Christmas gifts years ago \u2013 it\u2019s an expensive time of year and it just felt like another stressful chore. We\u2019ve extended this amnesty to my delighted stepfather who wanted nothing more than to be released from his annual trudge around the shops (now he makes Christmas cakes for people he would have given presents previously; they\u2019re delicious). \u2018I realise this could sound joyless; maybe it does\u2019: Emma Beddington. Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer What I\u2019m saying is I\u2019ve opted out of Christmas, I suppose. It\u2019s a little bit like this year\u2019s Marks & Spencer Christmas ad , in which celebrities ditch the traditions they hate: Tan France chucking the Monopoly board out of the window, Hannah Waddingham shredding paper crowns and Sophie Ellis-Bextor torching her unwritten Christmas cards. I\u2019ve pared Christmas down to the bits I want, it\u2019s just that in my case that\u2019s hardly anything. At some point in the past few years, I realised that none of this was actually obligatory, and if I didn\u2019t enjoy it, the sky wouldn\u2019t fall in if I just didn\u2019t bother. I know when that thought started to take root, actually; it was on the first Covid Christmas. With tight rules on household mixing , my sister stuck at home in Paris and my sons lounging at home in their pyjamas, my husband and I took bagels and smoked salmon round to my stepfather\u2019s house and sat outside, coats on, with a glass of champagne. We had a nice chat for half an hour or so, then we went home. The rest of the day was a pleasant blur of TV, snacks and naps. So many people were bereft that year, far from family and unable to enjoy their usual celebrations; guiltily, furtively, I loved it. There was no going back. I realise this could sound joyless; maybe it does. There are definitely a couple of hours on Christmas Day that can feel anticlimactic and underwhelming, especially when everyone is posting pictures of massive gatherings and uproarious meals; the fraught but happy chaos of family. But we\u2019re a household of people who don\u2019t much enjoy a fuss and quietly doing our own thing seems to work, at least for now. I make an effort to spend a bit of time with the people I love but don\u2019t live with during the wider season when I can \u2013 I enjoy their company more when we\u2019re not meeting up in the gravy-scented pressure cooker of Christmas Day. I enjoy company more when we\u2019re not meeting up in the gravy-scented pressure cooker of Christmas Day Or worse, maybe it sounds smug? I\u2019m not, honestly: I\u2019m an anxious introvert who used to make everyone miserable by being rigid and tense and on a hair trigger for days; I\u2019m just letting us all off that hook. But yes, Christmas is a time of tangled, complicated feelings of love and responsibility and traditions freighted with meaning. It\u2019s a time when absences can really ache: I know that. My mother used to throw a wonderful Christmas, unerringly buying us all thoughtful presents that felt like a treat, making her Christmas Eve seafood chowder, pouring drinks at the perfect moment, insisting we all walk to the cathedral on Christmas morning to \u201csee the baby Jesus\u201d they put in the manger. When she died, we didn\u2019t have the heart to do any of it and Christmas felt wrong for years. \u201cDo only what you love\u201d, the M&S ad says, but if something really matters for people you love, you can\u2019t just deprive them of it. I couldn\u2019t have called the whole thing off when my sons were younger and when we spend the day with my husband\u2019s French family every few years, it\u2019s a whole other long and extremely food-centred story. I wonder, too, if this is a temporary Christmas truce in my life: perhaps one day my sons will have kids and I\u2019ll be thrilled to provide the full festive hoopla? But if there\u2019s anything to be taken from my current tiny, quiet Christmases, I think it\u2019s that this day is supposed to be pleasurable, for everyone. If there\u2019s something that really saps the joy for you, could you possibly give yourself permission to ditch it next year? \u201cDon\u2019t do something you hate\u201d isn\u2019t as catchy as \u201cDo only what you love\u201d, but it might just be the secret to a happier Christmas.",

The highlight was watching my 93-year-old, home counties, tweed skirt, dry-sherry-and-the-Daily-Express grandmother get passively stoned while talking to a semi-professional gambler by the name of Lamb Chop. What did these two unlikely tablemates have in common? Well, Lamb Chop had made his living almost entirely from betting on horses, while my grandfather had been a horse vet and owner. And so, under the strings of Christmas cards, beside a roaring fire, with the strains of Bob Dylan\u2019s Bringing It All Back Home in the background, these two kept up a stream of conversation for about five hours. Derby winners. Flat form. Trainers. Stables. Jockey weight. Grand National hopefuls. Until you have watched a woman in an elasticated girdle and a blue rinse discuss Lester Piggott\u2019s storm to victory on The Minstrel in the 1977 Epsom Derby with a man smoking a roll-up the approximate size of a parsnip, then frankly, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve celebrated Christmas. For years, my Christmases had been spent in a flat, untouristy corner of north Shropshire, at my granny\u2019s house. We\u2019d watch the telly, eat off a special hostess trolley, put our pyjamas on in front of an electric fire and then watch a bit more telly for good measure. That house is still one of only two in the whole world that I can walk through entirely in my memory: the horse pictures up the stairs, the pink bathroom with my grandfather\u2019s old moustache comb, a cupboard under the stairs full of boot polish and binoculars and shoehorns. It is etched into me like DNA. A Christmas that changed me: my best friend and I celebrated in Australia \u2013 and finally felt like adults Read more When my grandmother got too old to host, we were incredibly lucky to get invited to the home of some friends of my mum\u2019s, who lived in a nearby town. They were as exotic and glamorous as my family were potato-shaped. They\u2019d lived in Kerala, used melted lead to tell fortunes, drank whisky, read a dazzling array of books, ate pink grapefruit for breakfast and shone with a kind of golden light, even when the weather outside looked like a rotten flannel. At Christmas, they gathered together an unlikely and often chaotic array of guests. In that house, I played Scrabble with a Jewish refugee who came to England in the 1930s, played Dream Phone with a grey-haired academic, ate muesli beside a photographer from Delhi, sewed up the broken zip on a tent with a paramedic and listened to stories of shark fishing in Achill, Ireland, beside an interior designer in pink trousers. That initial Christmas, spent around a huge table littered with wine glasses, dictionaries, ashtrays, photographs, miniature elephants, red cabbage and knitting \u2013 listening to my chain-smoking granny crackle out a commentary on the 1973 Cheltenham Champion Hurdle prospects of Comedy of Errors in a voice so low people always mistook her on the phone for a man \u2013 was the first time I really got Christmas. Started to enjoy it. Actively looked forward to it. That family, who weren\u2019t actually my family, showed me what Christmas was about. They were the children of refugees and hunt balls; they went to church and stayed up drinking until 3am; they wore jeans and had gold rings, and somehow that combination made them welcoming to all. They visited my granny, in her care home, until the day she died. I used to think that the ingredients for a good Christmas were a bulging stocking, a loud television, lots of food and a scattering of dog hair on the carpet. But that Christmas I learned that a couple of glasses of sherry, thick blue smoke and a hazy chat about the latest fixture at Kempton Park can go a long way, too.",

        "description": "Albums highly rated, but not reviewed, by our writers this year include debuts from Sanam, Priya Ragu and Current Affairs \u2013 and Lil Yachty\u2019s genre-hopping returnThe formation of Beirut six-piece Sanam is emblematic of Lebanon\u2019s thriving experimental music scene in and of itself: the group were convened at the behest of Irtijal festival for a collaboration with Hans Joachim Irmler of Faust, a juncture which catalysed the musicians into recording together later on.

        "content": "Sanam \u2013 Aykathani Malakon \u0635\u200b\u0646\u200b\u0645 - \u0623\u200b\u064a\u200b\u0642\u200b\u0638\u200b\u0646\u200b\u064a \u0645\u200b\u0644\u200b\u0627\u200b\u0643\u200b\u064c Sanam: Bell \u0635\u0646\u0645 - \u0628\u0644 \u2013 video The formation of Beirut six-piece Sanam is emblematic of Lebanon\u2019s thriving experimental music scene in and of itself: the group were convened at the behest of Irtijal festival for a collaboration with Hans Joachim Irmler of Faust, a juncture which catalysed the musicians into recording together later on. Their resulting debut, Aykathani Malakon (An Angel Woke Me), thoroughly embodies their originating influences, whipping up kosmische, post-punk, psych rock, free jazz and Levantine folklore into an alchemical tour de force delivered with a defiant, DIY disposition. Each track takes the experiment into a fantastically different direction. Intoxicating maqam improvisations are introduced through Farah Kaddour\u2019s buzuq over the stomping rhythm of 94, while Bell is pure chug as Antonio Hajj\u2019s bass rolls out space for skittish guitar riffs to join the fray. There\u2019s a take on a traditional Palestinian wedding song in Oula La Emmo (Tell His Mother), and interpolation of a Sayed Darwish composition amid the guttural slowcore of Ya Nass (O People). Ayouha Al-Taiin Fi Al-Mawt (He Who Stabs Death) is a total tempest, its post-rock buildup propelled by vocalist Sandy Chamoun. Her urgent, spine-tingling recitation of Paul Chaoul\u2019s poetry is left to resound long after the instruments\u2019 cathartic release. Beyond an assemblage of people, Sanam is a vehicle for cross-generational dialogue with Arab culture transcending disciplines \u2013 and what a ride their debut is. Tayyab Amin Jane Remover \u2013 Census Designated Jane Remover: Census Designated \u2013 video Shoegaze becomes skygaze in this ambitious, overwhelmingly beautiful album from the New Jersey musician (you may have heard her debut as Dltzk prior to coming out as a trans woman in 2022 and changing her name). Remover is rooted in the digicore and hyperpop sounds of recent years where trance, breakbeat, pop and bits of internet flotsam get flung together \u2013 she even coined her own blistering glitched-up subgenre, dariacore . That grounding means that when she picks up a guitar she makes it sound like no one else. Yes, there are the big down-chords and haze of shoegaze, plus the steady riffs of emo, the squall of alt-rock and the chiming loveliness of kosmische. But Remover is a superb arranger \u2013 she revitalises these staple guitar sounds by laying them against each other at oblique angles, dressing them with tufts of static and delicate metallic threads of noise. Her vocals meanwhile have the sugary melancholy of K-pop or Europop, but melted and slowed into a thick honey. There isn\u2019t a single weak song but the title track is the greatest realisation of her visionary approach, its earnest R&B chorus stood in an aircraft hangar of reverberant guitar tone. Ben Beaumont-Thomas Jalen Ngonda \u2013 Come Around and Love Me Jalen Ngonda: That\u2019s All I Wanted From You \u2013 video Jalen Ngonda clearly has an intriguing story \u2013 how did a Washington DC native with a voice that sounds not unlike that of the late Marvin Gaye fetch up in Liverpool? \u2013 but his debut album doesn\u2019t really require context. The work of someone possessed of an almost indecent amount of vocal talent \u2013 he soars effortlessly over subtly orchestrated arrangements, gritty enough to pack a real emotional punch but noticeably devoid of affectation \u2013 Come Around and Love Me is half an hour of untrammelled, joy: alternately breezily heart-lifting on the title track and If You Don\u2019t Want My Love and brooding, lovesick, on Just Like You Used to or What a Difference She Made. By his own account immersed in the Motown and Philly soul he grew up with, you could argue that its sound slots neatly into the retro remit of his label Daptone \u2013 he has talked about his love of Fleet Foxes and Angel Olsen, which suggests that there could be a more left-field side to his music yet to be revealed \u2013 but equally, there\u2019s a freshness and immediacy to his songwriting that sidesteps any sense of someone merely trying to recreate the past: both Come Around and Love Me and its author feel like a real find. Alexis Petridis Pupil Slicer \u2013 Blossom Pupil Slicer: Glaring Dark of Night / Momentary Actuality \u2013 video Fans expecting more meat-grinding mathcore on Pupil Slicer\u2019s second album were surprised by an expansive universe of reverb, hooks, and (god forbid) clean singing. On Blossom, the extreme UK band more precisely harness the chaos of their 2021 debut Mirrors, allowing room for riffs to breathe and song structures to stretch into further realms of experimentation without ever feeling forced or bloated. Video game Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker was one inspiration behind the album, and the band adopt the game\u2019s apocalyptic narrative in tracks like the post-metal influenced The Song at Creation\u2019s End. Its introduction provides the album with a moment of introspection and respite, but pulls in elements of black metal, groove metal, and metalcore as it builds \u2013 a feat of balance which the Pupil Slicer of 2021 may well have shied away from. This band have always worn their influences on their sleeves, but although Blossom sounds like a million different things, it could only really have been made by Pupil Slicer. Rosie Solomon Priya Ragu \u2013 Santhosam Priya Ragu: Easy \u2013 video The Swiss-Sri Lankan musician Priya Ragu named her debut album after the Tamil word for happiness, and Santhosam is a beacon of joy and hope in the face of personal challenges. Buoyant and jubilant, it\u2019s a feat of musical worldbuilding, melding the punchy pop sounds Ragu grew up with in the 90s and 00s with the south Asian sounds she was exposed to at home. Hit the Bucket is a bass-fuelled body mover that pays ode to family music sessions, while gleeful Adalam Va! is packed with vivacious vocals and syncopated, upbeat rhythms. Priya Ragu: \u2018Tamil is the language I speak. Why not put it in my songs?\u2019 Read more It\u2019s also deeply personal and defiant. Born to refugee Sri Lankan-Tamil parents in Switzerland, Ragu found herself having to assimilate into her physical environment in Europe while being expected to mould to the south Asian cultural norms upheld by her family. \u201cHow can I stay awake for somebody else dream?\u201d she asks in School Me Like That, driven by a rolling tabla beat and zesty vocals. The album closes on the Tamil-language ballad Mani Osai, a heartfelt and intimate showing of her family\u2019s closeness. Santhosam marks the arrival of a boisterous, charming and confident new pop voice. Aneesa Ahmed Current Affairs \u2013 Off the Tongue Current Affairs: No Fuss \u2013 video Emerging from the endlessly fertile Glasgow DIY music scene, Current Affairs marry agile new wave guitar riffs with a melancholic gothic attitude to create songs that refuse to be forgotten. Although Off the Tongue is their debut album, the post-punk band has existed in various iterations since 2016 and all four members are veterans of the UK music scene, including frontwoman Joan Sweeney, guitarist Sebastian Ymai, bassist Gemma Fleet and drummer Andrew Milk. The current lineup met through the Spite House collective, a local initiative to promote queer and female-fronted musicians. (It\u2019s also the band\u2019s final lineup: they have announced that they are splitting at the end of the year.) Their politics careen through the heart of the record, turning each song into a call to action. On Right Time, Sweeney yelps confidently over an elastic, racing guitar riff: \u201cWe\u2019ll be, ready, you\u2019ll see, you got me / It\u2019s the right time.\u201d While they\u2019re clearly influenced by post-punk acts such as Magazine and Siouxsie and the Banshees, they\u2019re not overly derivative, and they venture outside their wheelhouse on softer songs such as Her Own Private Multiverse. Off the Tongue is an apt title: each lyric is spat out, every riff rolls from the tips of their fingers \u2013 the soundtrack to a justifiable anger that for now can only be danced away. Stephanie Phillips Ryan Beatty \u2013 Calico Ryan Beatty: Ribbons \u2013 video Ryan Beatty has spent a good chunk of his decade-plus career in limbo. Primed for teenage stardom as the next Justin Bieber in 2011, Beatty extricated himself from his label deal after two EPs then came out as gay. Collaborations with Brockhampton and Tyler, the Creator followed, while his first two albums \u2013 2018\u2019s horny, soft-pop debut, Boy in Jeans, and 2020\u2019s fractured, electro-odyssey Dreaming of David \u2013 searched for both emotional and sonic stability. Ryan Beatty was set to be the next Bieber \u2013 then he realised he was living a lie Read more On the mainly acoustic Calico, Beatty, now 28, returns to his childhood home town in California and finds an anchor. Inspired by the James Taylor and John Denver records his dad would play on a loop, the album\u2019s nine burnished, softly unfurling tracks riffle through his emotional baggage with pin-sharp self-reflection. Opener Ribbons, all plaintive piano and lilting strings, picks over a breakup (\u201cIt\u2019s brave to b\u0435 nothing to no one at all,\u201d he sighs, his crystalline voice front and centre) with devastating precision, while the hymnal Little Faith tackles deteriorating mental health with a deft touch. Throughout Calico, Beatty and his band \u2013 augmented by Bon Iver\u2019s Justin Vernon \u2013 make space for his richly rewarding melodies and intricate storytelling to breathe. The stately White Teeth, for example, balances on closely mic-ed guitar plucks and slithers of strings but feels vast, while Bruises Off the Peach finds Beatty extricating himself from a toxic relationship over an airy folk-pop confection. Patient, and rewarding of patience, Calico already feels like a classic. Michael Cragg Nourished By Time \u2013 Erotic Probiotic 2 Nourished By Time: The Fields \u2013 video The streaming age generated a new era of analogue fetishism, with dozens of musicians crusting classic sounds in sepia and static to dodge the piercing sharpness of life in high-def. Despite a good 15 years of now-entrenched hypnagogic tropes, Baltimore\u2019s Marcus Brown manages to stir a totally original stew of sounds on their debut album, smearing tentpole genres from new jack swing to freestyle and soul at its most poised in a swaddling impasto haze. Their production is scrappy but opulent, a protective and defiantly regal cape for these songs about fighting fear, finding freedom in a capitalist society built off the back of enslaved people \u2013 \u201cI can still feel the cotton / And the heat from the fields / Made the country so damn rich / Ain\u2019t no way to heal,\u201d they balladeer on Worker\u2019s Interlude \u2013 and staying grounded when relationships falter. Their themes of sex, socialism and subjugation hit hard but never weigh heavy, couched in fuzzily buoyant, earwormy choruses that are almost as affirming as classic Lionel Richie or Barry White refrains. These are songs for the bedroom, the dancefloor, the protest, for the trip from the gutter to the stars: the arrival of a voice that\u2019s unmistakable even through the decadent murk. Laura Snapes Hifi Sean & David McAlmont \u2013 Happy Ending Hifi Sean & David McAlmont: Beautiful \u2013 video It\u2019s an unlikely but inspired coupling: Sean Dickson, singer of Scottish I\u2019m Free hitmakers Soup Dragons, and David McAlmont, the glorious voice best known for his work with Bernard Butler. After initially collaborating for one track on Dickson\u2019s 2016 solo album Ft, this full-length allows their ideas to reach fruition. It\u2019s dreamily danceable soul \u2013 think Seal or Massive Attack circa Unfinished Symphony \u2013 which allows McAlmont\u2019s sublime, yearning vocals to wander through gently insistent bass, tastefully understated percussion and Bollywood composer Chandra Jois\u2019s swooping Indian strings. Maybe and The Fever are classy pop constructions \u2013 the latter with shades of Burt Bacharach\u2019s work with Dionne Warwick \u2013 while All in the World finds dancefloor euphoria. Elsewhere, there are curveballs. Aurora (Parts 1 & 2) is a hazy, almost psychedelic sound-voice collage while the superb The Skin I\u2019m in draws connections between the rise of the Third Reich, Black Lives Matter and the murder of George Floyd: \u201cMama I\u2019m fading fast, now the badge is on my ass with teargas / I nearly got a rubber bullet in the eye \u2026 They don\u2019t believe I can\u2019t breathe.\u201d A thoughtful, emotional, postmodern gem. Dave Simpson Lil Yachty \u2013 Let\u2019s Start Here Lil Yachty: Let\u2019s Start Here \u2013 video Let\u2019s Start Here is Lil Yachty\u2019s fifth album, but the title makes clear that it\u2019s a new beginning. From the opening guitar chords and pounding drums of first song The Black Seminole, Yachty\u2019s intent is clear: he is no longer a trap artist, he is a psychedelic genre-hopper, capable of commanding high-quality session musicians. He\u2019s not alone in making this shift \u2013 coupled with Lil Uzi Vert\u2019s psych-inspired 2023 album Pink Tape, it invites reflections on how their era, the class of 2016, have diverged into psychedelic new terrains while the genre\u2019s elder statesman: Drake, Travis, Cole and Kanye West plough the same lanes to diminishing returns. Might looking back to the sounds of the 60s and 70s inspire a new beginning for the genre? I expect a legion of imitators will answer the question before long. Sasha Mistlin",

Health concerns trouble not only the older population of Peru, but also the children who grow up amid contamination. Here disease and early death are more than facts of life: they emerge as a disturbing kind of intergenerational inheritance. The country\u2019s dependence on mining stifles the possibilities of alternative career paths. There is talk of artistic aspirations and dreams of playing football, but these have been extinguished by a lack of financial support. As Bauer\u2019s film unfolds over a week-long celebration of Peru\u2019s independence day, such laments are juxtaposed with radio broadcasts and parades, activities that mark the nation\u2019s liberation from Spanish rule. Any jubilance, however, is undercut with a sense of discontent. When the film alights at the Port of Callao, one of the dock workers bemoans Peru\u2019s lack of manufacturing industry, which leads the country to export its natural resources on the cheap. By examining this form of ongoing economic colonialism, Steel Life profoundly exposes another dimension to Peru\u2019s history of imperial colonialismion. Steel Life is available from 29 December on True Story.",

The other day, as I was waiting outside a cafe with a friend\u2019s dog, the barista urged me to bring her inside. For years, Britons\u2019 non-partisan passion for animals has been consistent amid dwindling common ground. But lately, rather than bringing out the best in us, our relationship with dogs is increasingly revealing us at our worst \u2013 and our supposed \u201cbest friends\u201d are paying the price. As with so many latent traits in the national psyche, it all came unleashed with the pandemic, when many people thought they might as well make the most of all that time at home and in local parks with a dog. Between 2019 and 2022 , the number of pet dogs in the UK rose from about nine million to 13 million. But there\u2019s long been a seasonal surge around this time of year, substantial enough for the Dogs Trust charity to coin its famous slogan back in 1978: \u201cA dog is for life, not just for Christmas.\u201d Green spaces, meanwhile, have been steadily declining , and now many of us have returned to the office, just as those \u201cpandemic dogs\u201d are entering their troublesome teens. It\u2019s a combustible combination and we are already seeing the results: the number of dog attacks recorded by police in England and Wales rose by more than a third between 2018 and 2022. At the same time, sites such as Pets4Homes.co.uk are replete with listings for dogs that, their owners accept \u201cwith deep regret\u201d, are no longer suited to their lifestyles now that lockdown is over. It may have felt as if it would go on for ever, but was there ever any suggestion it was going to last the average dog\u2019s lifespan of a decade? Living beings are being downgraded to mere commodities. You can see it reflected the \u201cdesigner\u201d breeds currently in fashion , the French bulldogs and pugs that look cute but spend their entire lives in discomfort. American XL bulldogs, now so controversial, are often sought after as a signifier of masculinity: roping an entire other life in service of our egos. Historically, many of Britain\u2019s most popular breeds evolved to hunt vermin, retrieve game, herd, or otherwise do a specific job alongside humans; these days we are breeding and buying them for their aesthetic appeal. Underpinning this is a shift to what was long disdained as the \u201cAmerican\u201d approach: treating pets as substitutes for children. In the past in Britain, dogs were treasured on their own terms, for the qualities that made them dogs, and as such, sometimes better than people: their friendliness and trustingness and how they opened up the world for us. They were indulged, certainly \u2013 by allowing them on to the sofa or in our beds, for instance, when we\u2019d sworn we never would \u2013 but in ways that did not negate or deny their essential otherness. Now we have more dogs of such ludicrous proportions, they struggle to function as dogs at all \u2013 and we treat them accordingly, indulging them as we would ourselves: by buying unnecessary things. The total spend on pets in the UK has more than doubled in the past decade, reaching nearly \u00a310bn last year. That huge rise has not just come from essentials: figures from the marketing agency Mintel suggest that one in five UK owners like their pet to \u201ckeep up with the latest trends\u201d in grooming or, heaven forbid, outfits. These days pet \u201cboutiques\u201d \u2013 like the one that recently opened on my street in Norwich, selling \u201ccold-pressed\u201d dog treats, \u201cpaw and nose balms\u201d and spa services \u2013 are a widespread sign of gentrification. But it\u2019s not just wealthier areas: this summer in Great Yarmouth, one of the most deprived towns in the country, I noticed seaside stalls selling not one but two brands of ice-cream for dogs. It suggests dog-lovers have become untethered from their companions\u2019 desires, let alone their needs. Let\u2019s be honest: most dogs would be thrilled to bits to be eating a paper bag, or even their own faeces. And although they are certainly delighted by ice-cream, they don\u2019t need it. But the ways we ourselves find solace \u2013 in consumption, by indulging our simian \u201ctreat brain\u201d with things that we don\u2019t need and/or aren\u2019t good for us \u2013 we have simply extended to our pets. It\u2019s hard not to see the rise in dog-friendly restaurants, cinema screenings and even churches as similar to the ludicrous expenditure: a way to placate the two-legged being on the end of the lead (regardless of the experience of others in the vicinity). Meanwhile, many dogs suffer daily deprivation, their worlds made small and monotonous by our busy modern schedules. These are social animals: it\u2019s not natural for them to live without other dogs, let alone in an empty house for eight hours a day, Monday to Friday. If we are besieged by badly behaved dogs, the cause isn\u2019t hard to pinpoint. Many behavioural problems can be alleviated and even addressed by sufficient exercise, supervision and consistent routines, but instead of organising our lives so that our pets may thrive, we show our love with a Halloween-themed cookie, or a new outfit for Instagram likes. It\u2019s easy to forget that we are sharing our homes with a descendant of the wolf when it is dressed in sheep\u2019s clothing; but the more we learn about animals, the clearer it becomes that our treatment of them, simultaneously adoring and alienated, means they are leading strange, unsatisfying simulacra of the lives they ought to lead. But for as long as we choose to share our lives with pets, the bar should be the same as for any relationship we value: being prepared to make sacrifices for their wellbeing, prioritising quality time and care, and loving them as they are \u2013 not for how they reflect on us, or how we\u2019d like them to be.

I could take or leave the boiled sprouts, but I devoured everything else: the pigs in blankets, stuffing, roast potatoes, red cabbage, parsnips, carrots, cranberry sauce, gravy \u2026 After dinner, we exchanged more presents with our aunt and uncle, cousins and grandparents, and watched the Queen\u2019s speech. Then it was 4pm and time for tea. This was a lighter affair: just a whole ham, boiled eggs, bread and butter, salad, homegrown and pickled onions, rounded off with Christmas cake and sherry trifle. A few hours later, we tucked into supper. This was a mainly pastry-based event involving warm sausage rolls and mince pies, plus cheese and biscuits. Between meals, we kept hunger pangs at bay with Roses and Quality Street chocolates, and those fancy mixed nuts that you have to crack yourself. The incredible thing about this day of gluttony was that we repeated it all the next day at my grandparents\u2019 house. The Boxing Day menu was almost identical, except that we had tinned salmon instead of ham at teatime. Then \u2013 I kid you not \u2013 we did it all over again on the 27th, this time with my mum and dad hosting. Three days of the same food, the same company and the same entertainment (games of cards and dominoes). Feasting, family and ferocious competition: I loved it. But by my late teens, I was spending Christmas Eve in the pub with friends and no longer getting up so early the next morning. Then, in 2000, came the first year that I stayed at my then boyfriend\u2019s house on Christmas Eve, and experienced someone else\u2019s Christmas morning traditions (a lie-in and a fry-up). The two of us had been invited to my aunt\u2019s for dinner as usual, but, perhaps unsurprisingly, we were late setting off. We had assumed, with the arrogance of youth, that everyone would wait for us \u2013 not for a moment considering the careful timings that ensured the turkey was always on the table at 12 sharp, nor the hours of work that got it there. They were halfway through the meal when we arrived. There was still masses of turkey, but the trimmings had been seriously depleted. Not even a sprout remained. My poor aunt Marion, panicking, heated up a tin of baked beans and dumped half on to each of our plates. My boyfriend, who had heard tales of the banquet awaiting him, was \u2026 taken aback (luckily he loved beans). I was mortified. My dad \u2013 Marion\u2019s brother \u2013 was annoyed with us for being so late, whereas my mum was horrified that no one had saved us any veg (she eats broccoli and cauliflower with everything, even pizza). I wish I could say that was the last Christmas I was ever late, but sadly that would be a lie. Instead, I think it was the year I grew up and realised the world didn\u2019t revolve around me. Also, I\u2019ve since turned vegan, so now I always take my own (meat-free) stuffing balls and pigs in blankets to other people\u2019s houses \u2013 it\u2019s not Christmas dinner without them. Anyway, we ate our turkey and baked beans. After all, there was still tea and supper to come. And the Boxing Day feast. And the one on the 27th \u2026",

Here, five people share their celebrations. A labour of love lasagne Vijeta Venkataraman My family is Hindu but my parents have always been really curious about the universal message in all religions. And my family\u2019s Christmas tradition in Australia, where we all now live, revolves around a very special lasagne. All set for \u20186kg of cheesy bliss\u2019 In the 70s my grandfather worked for Air India and my grandmother was a housekeeper. During a stint in Brooklyn, New York, my tiny, sari-clad Indian grandmother was taught a vegetarian lasagne recipe from an Italian American family \u2013 revolutionary for my grandmother at the time. She had grown up, like everyone else around her, only eating Indian food. Photo trees and handmade nativities: four families on their Christmas traditions Read more Ten years later, my dad, who grew up in Tirunelveli, in the south of India, went to meet my mother for the first time at my grandparents\u2019 house. The etiquette for this kind of meeting \u2013 one with a view to arranging a marriage \u2013 is to welcome your guest with something typically south Indian to \u201cshow your culture\u201d. Instead, my grandmother, who never cared much for those kinds of customs, decided to make my father a giant, steaming tray of authentic NYC lasagne. My father had never seen anything like it. His horizons were opened. Love blossomed. It became a part of the family lore. I can\u2019t overestimate what a labour of love this lasagne is every Christmas. It involves so much preparation and planning: the eggplant is salted days in advance, two sauces are alchemised, two very specific lasagne pans are produced from an ancient crockery cupboard. Whether it\u2019s between two immigrants in New York City in the 70s, or between a mother and child in Sydney, now, love is being shared so that we can be fed by it and pass it along. I\u2019m lucky enough to have that love in abundance; and to my delight, baked into 6kg of cheesy bliss. Themed food at a family feast Bella Al-karkhey My Arab mum is obsessed with Christmas. My parents both grew up in super religious Muslim households but they themselves didn\u2019t connect to it, and they\u2019ve raised my siblings and I in a non-practising environment. Religion always felt like an afterthought in our home. We do celebrate Ramadan and Eid but, for us, that\u2019s more about community and culture. So when it comes to Christmas we go all out as well. Like Eid and Ramadan, it\u2019s a great opportunity for us to bring everyone together and share food and laughter. \u2018Holiday punch\u2019, one of the eccentric themed elements of Bella Al-karkhey\u2019s family feast My mum will take any opportunity to decorate the house with fairy lights and garlands. She also loves Christmas-themed food, and I don\u2019t mean a roast or anything traditional. I mean eccentric little dishes from TikTok, like pull-apart garlic bread in the shape of a Christmas tree, or chocolate-covered pine cones, or \u201choliday punch\u201d. And my dad loves to give people presents. He\u2019s a writer as well so he loves any excuse to gift people books (even those who don\u2019t read). For the big day itself, we always make a feast. It always involves a roast, whether that\u2019s chicken or beef or lamb. I love to make side dishes that have a Middle Eastern bent to them \u2013 think garlic roasted carrots drizzled with a lemon tahini yoghurt sauce, or pomegranate cocktails. And lastly, the most constant of all, an over-the-top charcuterie table (yes, table) filled with everything you can think of. Danish cinema and fancy champagne, solo Jess Ho I grew up in a very religious Christian Baptist household. When I was younger and more open to ideas, I considered myself agnostic but I think ageing has influenced that. Now I\u2019m an atheist. I\u2019ve never lost sight of the true meaning of Christmas: my birthday | Walter Marsh Read more Even though I grew up in a religious household, we never really did Christmas. As I grew older, when I was invited to a friend\u2019s Christmas, I felt as though I was in the way. So since then I\u2019ve spent the day on my own, drinking grower champagne in my underpants and watching Lars von Trier films. It sounds depressing but I guarantee you it isn\u2019t. I like it because there are no expectations. I have a lot of friends who aren\u2019t religious but spend Christmas with their families and they\u2019re so stressed beforehand. They feel obliged to spend Christmas with their families because it\u2019s tradition, but it always ends in arguments. It\u2019s nice to know I can avoid that. Now that I\u2019m a bit older I have more money, so I try to be in Asia over the holiday period, where Christmas always takes a back seat to the lunar new year. It\u2019s business as usual and everything is open. It doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have a drink in my room and watch confronting Danish cinema on my laptop, though. It\u2019s been over a decade of this and I am such a sicko \u2013 I look forward to it every year. Raveena Grover with Shivani Beach in the sunshine, board games in the rain Raveena Grover Culturally I\u2019m Hindu. I grew up Hindu, practising customs that were important to my family, like Rakhi and Diwali, and abstaining from eating meat during certain times of the year. Christmas is a funny time of year for me. My family is often working, as is my close friend Shivani\u2019s family. So, for the last five or six years Shivani and I have either done a beach or board game day on Christmas. (It\u2019s weather-dependent.) Since neither of our families celebrate Christmas in the classic sense and we always have the day off, we\u2019ve made it a tradition to spend it together doing something we enjoy. Shivani is also culturally Hindu, so it\u2019s a great way to feel connected to our community during a day that is reserved for doing so. It\u2019s strengthened our bond. And it\u2019s become our own secular, somewhat Hindu-coded Christmas tradition. Waking up early to keep the country company Alice Zaslavsky For my Georgian-Jewish family, Christmas Day was just another day in December. Dad would mow the lawn. Now I have in-laws who have always celebrated Christmas, so that has given us another opportunity to feast and come together. I\u2019ve catered Christmas lunch for our extended families a few times and it\u2019s fun. We really leaned in and went ham on it. This year we decorated a tree for the first time with our four-year-old daughter \u2013 I repurposed some dehydrated oranges for it \u2013 so it\u2019s becoming a proper Chrismukkah now. And we\u2019ll keep it up for novi god (new year), so December is full of festivities. Alice Zaslavsky in the studio on Christmas Day But on Christmas morning, from 6.30am to 10am, I\u2019ll be hosting the national breakfast show on ABC local radio. It\u2019s a relatively new tradition for me, my second year, but there are many listeners who have been tuning in much longer. I know some people will be waking up without a gathering or company to look forward to. The radio is a place they can come for companionship. We\u2019ll get people calling in from isolated areas to wish everyone a merry Christmas, who tell us it\u2019s their one opportunity to do so that day. Because I\u2019m a cook, last year I got a lot of questions about catering like, \u2018Help! I\u2019ve split the custard.\u2019 I got to be Agony Alice for three and a half hours. I\u2019m mindful Australia\u2019s a multicultural country, so I want to balance my \u201cmerry Christmases\u201d with my \u201chappy festive seasons\u201d and my \u201chello, it\u2019s Monday\u201d. Some friends have suggested that hosting a live, call-in radio show sounds like an annoying thing to do at 6.30am on Christmas morning. But it\u2019s actually an honour.",

The bullies would just want to get to me, so I was never left alone, therefore I didn\u2019t go out.\u201d Pace-Humphreys is talking about her memoir, Black Sheep , which documents her experiences of growing up in Stroud, Gloucestershire, in the 1980s and 90s. Though this incident of being attacked doesn\u2019t appear in it, many other instances of what she labels \u201crural racism\u201d do. They dovetail into a short but punchy memoir that covers pregnancy in her teens, postpartum depression, alcoholism, ultramarathon running and, eventually, her decision to launch the campaigning charity Black Trail Runners . At 45, Pace-Humphreys has lived, by most people\u2019s standards, a remarkable life. She\u2019s still based in Stroud, where she lives with her husband and the youngest of her children. On the day we meet, she is straight down to business, a whirlwind of contained energy and bright smiles, blonde and auburn curls pulled back from her face. She\u2019s dressed in running gear and excited to show me a little of her world. Alongside her charity and activism work, and leading running groups, she has recently become a personal trainer. I can go really deep to get what I need. I\u2019ve always had to do that It\u2019s an unseasonably warm day and she\u2019s taken me to one of her favourite spots, the Randwick Wood trail on the outskirts of Stroud. It\u2019s a path lined with beech and yew trees, at points opening out on to glorious views of the Gloucestershire countryside, the River Severn shimmering in the distance. Being interviewed while running might be a breathless experience, but Pace-Humphreys takes it in her stride, slowing when she can see I\u2019m struggling but in such a way that it doesn\u2019t make me feel guilty for not sustaining the pace. The outdoors has become a place of joy and excitement for her, as well as a refuge. \u201cFinally, to feel that somewhere in the outdoors is safe just to be yourself, I think for me, and many others, is healing,\u201d she says. \u201cI have been on these trails when things have been particularly challenging. I just cry, scream.\u201d She didn\u2019t always feel this way about running. \u201cWhen I was younger, it was something I saw as a punishment,\u201d she says. But after suffering severe postpartum depression in 2009 and seeking advice from her doctor, she decided to give it a go. Her thoughts were so dark, she says, that she was willing to try anything. Out she went on a trail run (by definition, a run on an unpaved path in the outdoors), overweight and wearing a pair of unsuitable Dunlop shoes, baggy pants and a T-shirt. She shuffled along for 15 minutes before turning back, but even though the conditions were less than ideal, something clicked. \u201cDuring the run, I didn\u2019t have a single thought about taking my own life and it was so freeing,\u201d she says. She would go on to lead running groups for other women like her and compete in some of the world\u2019s toughest races across vast distances and terrifying terrain, including the epic, exhausting Marathon des Sables , often billed as the toughest footrace in the world, a 250km ultramarathon in the Sahara Desert. Making tracks: Sabrina Pace-Humphreys, co-founder and trustee of the community and campaigning charity Black Trail Runners. Photograph: Emli Bendixen/The Observer Pace-Humphreys was born in 1977 to a white Scottish mother and a Black father. They met in Manchester, fell in love, moved to Taunton and had two babies in quick succession \u2013 Pace-Humphreys and her younger sister. When her parents separated, Pace-Humphreys\u2019s mother moved with her children to Stroud to be closer to family. But her mother struggled with heartbreak and mental health issues, and Pace-Humphreys and her sister grew up in poverty, receiving food parcels from the Samaritans. Her father, dealing with his own demons, wasn\u2019t in the picture much, though he has come back into her life in recent years. She was an isolated, shy child, contending with the experience of being visibly mixed heritage in a predominately white, often hostile environment. \u201cI couldn\u2019t share it with anyone. My sister is white presenting. And she never ever faced any form of racism,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was a time when I hated being mixed-race and being seen as different. I just wanted to be white like everyone else.\u201d In the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020, the racism she experienced growing up was compounded by the assumption that Stroud was a progressive place (in fact, it is the home of Extinction Rebellion). Though Pace-Humphreys loves her life there, she has also felt the obstinance and wrath of people unwilling to acknowledge their ignorance and prejudice. Even so, she says, \u201cI will use my voice as much as I can to amplify the pain points and have conversations around racism, around diversifying the outdoors, around alcoholism, around mental health, because so many people have said to me that I have voiced what they couldn\u2019t. And if what I\u2019ve been through allows me to do that, then that\u2019s my gift.\u201d \u2018Because I coach a lot of women, I really try to get rid of that fear around inclines and hills\u2019: Sabrina Pace-Humphreys. Back on the trail, we\u2019re midway through our run now, which has turned into more of a walk. When I ask Pace-Humphreys if this feels like light work in comparison to her ultramarathons she diverts the question. \u201cThis is such a nice pace,\u201d she smiles, gesturing at the hill in front of us. \u201cThis is our significant little hill. Because I coach a lot of women, I really try to get rid of that fear around inclines and hills. I\u2019m like, a hill\u2019s a friend.\u201d Even so, she later admits, she knows she has a deep well of resilience that allows her to take on physical challenges in a unique way. \u201cPeople will say to me, \u2018Where do you get your resilience, your energy?\u2019 For example, with running, \u2018How can you run 200 miles? How do you not stop?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI have this deep well. I can go really deep to get what I need. Because I\u2019ve always had to do that. I\u2019ve always had to be able to survive.\u201d In a mountain race in the French Alps in 2019, this resilience was in full force. Pace-Humphreys was left dangling off the edge of a snowy mountain, screaming for help, inches from falling to her death. Her plight, she says, was ignored by five white, male runners who didn\u2019t stop to help her up. The sixth man, thankfully, did. She puts her mistreatment down to racism, to the fact that those men couldn\u2019t see her as vulnerable, as needing assistance. \u201cIt brings it back to the fact that there is this lack of diversity in many of these events. When you\u2019re not treated with the same kind of welfare response, or like any human would treat another human because of bias, then that\u2019s a problem,\u201d she says, adding that although she tried to raise the issue, the organisers didn\u2019t engage with her. She was further radicalised in 2020 after the death of Ahmaud Arbery , a 25-year-old Black man, who was murdered by two white men while out running in the US. Black Trail Runners was born out of the righteous anger and frustration she felt about the safety of Black people in the outdoors, and ended up becoming a space where she found her people \u2013 those who could relate to her on a level that her family never could. \u201cI grew up around white people,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I have created this community of the most wonderful humans from around the world and honestly, when we do trail runs together, it is just the most beautiful thing.\u201d Alongside organising meet-ups and fighting for the representation of Black runners, the charity addresses key barriers to access, providing transportation, navigation and kit. According to Pace-Humphreys, while 4.5% of the UK population identifies as Black and Black-mixed, less than 0.7% of participants at UK trail-running events are people of colour. \u201cPeople think there\u2019s more diversity because they see the likes of Eliud Kipchoge and Mo Farah winning marathons, but the idea that running is one of the most inclusive sports is a myth. There is a massive lack of diversity,\u201d she adds. Earlier this year, in an effort to start to counteract that reality, she organised Black to the Trails , which she believes was the UK\u2019s first trail-running event designed, directed and run by Black runners. With more than 400 attenders, it was a huge success and she is already planning for the 2024 event. This year she also appeared on the new British version of the long-running reality TV show Survivor , one of 18 participants who had to figure out how to survive in a remote location. She was eliminated early in the competition, but found it a valuable experience to be \u201crepresenting for the women of colour, the mums, the grandmums\u201d. We\u2019ve finished the run and, hopping back into Pace-Humphreys\u2019s car, we wind our way through the backroads of Stroud, past fields with cows and horses. It\u2019s a quaint town centre, a beautiful place but, unsurprisingly, I don\u2019t spot any other Black people. Because of this, and her experiences of racism, Pace-Humphreys says, people often ask her why she hasn\u2019t left Stroud and moved somewhere with more diversity. She hates that question. \u201cWhy should I have to be the one to leave?\u201d she says. \u201cThis is my home.\u201d Black Sheep by Sabrina Pace-Humphreys (Quercus, \u00a39.99) is available from guardianbookshop.com for \u00a39.29.

        "content": "M ost families have an annual Christmas tradition. It could be a buck\u2019s fizz in the morning, a post-lunch game of Scrabble or even that yearly heated political debate. But a new custom has entered the festive lexicon: family pyjamas. Everyone from grandparents to grandchildren and even fur babies are donning the same style of nightwear to create the ultimate family photo for social media. It\u2019s a trend that started in the US, but homogenous pyjama dressing has taken off in the UK. On the high street M&S, John Lewis, Next and Primark all sell family pyjama sets. (Some even include matching jackets and bandanas for the family dog.) M&S were one of the earlier British retailers to adopt the trend, selling its first matching family sets in 2017. \u201cThey were an instant hit with customers and we\u2019ve seen the demand grow ever since,\u201d says Sarah Ayling, head of lingerie and sleepwear buying. This Christmas, the high street giant has six different designs ranging from traditional tartan prints to tropical jungle foliage. But its \u201cdisco Santa\u201d motif is proving most popular \u2013 so far more than 500,000 sets have been sold. Elsewhere, sales are up 40% at Gap, with bestsellers including red- and green-check flannel sets. A spokesperson for the online nightwear shop Cyberjammies describes this year\u2019s sales as \u201cphenomenal\u201d. Its cotton Whistler collection , featuring illustrations of skiers and fir trees, has consistently sold out since it launched in September. Some of Primark\u2019s Grinch-themed sets, meanwhile, are selling for double the retail price on eBay. Check mates \u2026 M+S family pyjamas. Rather than tiger parents dictating what their children wear, the trend is being fuelled by gen Alpha and gen Z. On TikTok, the term Christmas pyjamas has almost 70m views, with tweens and teens forcing older family members to don a pair then lip-sync to Christmas songs or catwalk around the kitchen. \u201cWe like to identify with the people we love,\u201d says Dr Sandra Wheatley, a clinical psychologist. \u201cAs a family, you are one unit, but it doesn\u2019t always feel that way. Wearing matching pyjamas is akin to putting on a family uniform.

In the modern day, it is celebrities who have catalysed the trend. The Kardashian-Jenners favour plaid styles (though Kim dressed her kids in all-red snowflakes this year ), Diana Ross and her clan like candy-cane stripes, while the Beckhams\u2019 annual embossed silky sets are said to be from Olivia von Halle, a luxury London-based pyjama-maker whose prices start from \u00a3320. If you would like to try it out but don\u2019t think your family will go for all-out matching pyjamas, why not go for nightwear in similar colours? \u201cIt makes it a bit cooler,\u201d says Tom Pyne of the UK pyjama and loungewear brand Chelsea Peers. \u201cPlus, it\u2019s more versatile.

The village is the birthplace of some of France\u2019s most famous guides, with gorgeous winter walks mapped from the village, offering spectacular views of Mont Blanc, and easy access to both Switzerland and Italy through the Mont Blanc tunnel.

Non-skiers are well catered for with dog sledding, ice climbing and forest bathing, along with the chance to tackle a piste on a mountain kart, or swoop above the slopes on a tandem paraglide.

Walkers and nature lovers should drop into the Hohe Mut Alm exhibition on the Oetztal glacier, its flora and fauna and the effects of climate change, while non-skiers can hike, snowshoe or dip into the Aqua Dome in nearby Soelden, a thermal spa with hot outdoor pools. The Moss is a newly renovated hotel with a contemporary feel and clean design, and a brand new wellness area with indoor pool, sauna and steam room. Doubles from \u00a3138 B&B; themoss.at Hotel Meleze, Grimentz, Switzerland Photograph: Getty Images Tucked away in the spectacularly beautiful Val d\u2019Anniviers, Grimentz is a charming village dotted with mazot (traditional stone and wooden farmhouses) and flower-decked chalets, with lift access to excellent off-piste and touring terrain. A lattice of winter hiking trails fans out from the village, along with toboggan and cross-country ski runs, perfect for working up an appetite for the hearty Valais cuisine and the town\u2019s unique glacier wine, aged for 10-15 years in larchwood barrels and known as the \u201cSherry\u201d of Valais.

Snowboarders will love the Superpark , with all manner of jumps and half- and quarter-pipes, while non-skiers can explore the 40km of hiking trails.

Relatively undiscovered by the British market, it\u2019s also perfect for a few days of classic Alpine scenery, snowshoe hikes and sleigh rides, with lunch on the terrace at the K\u00fchtaier Dorfstadl offering panoramic mountain views and hearty Tirolean classics of Wienerschnitzel and gr\u00f6stl (fried potatoes and bacon topped with a fried egg).

Tight building restrictions mean the village has escaped any high-rise developments or sprawling hotels. Even in the school holidays the lifts are relatively quiet and the pistes uncrowded, making it a great family choice, with horse-drawn sleigh rides and ice skating on offer for those not wishing to ski. What apr\u00e8s ski there is centred around the Happy Filzmoos , in the slick new Alpin Bar 87 , or the more traditional Happy\u2019s Umbrella Bar.

The smell. It\u2019s been three years since I lost it. November 2020. I was living with three friends in a flat in Glasgow when we all caught Covid in the pre-vaccine days. Two of us lost our smell and never fully recovered it. We\u2019re in good company. Around 700,000 people in the UK are believed to have total smell loss caused by the virus, with around six million still experiencing some olfactory dysfunction. I estimate mine has returned by about 30%, but it\u2019s inconsistent and often distorted. To summarise my symptoms of anosmia, as total or partial loss of smell is known: some things have a faint odour, some don\u2019t smell as they should and others don\u2019t smell at all. For example: basil smells mild but good, ground coffee and a certain brand of toothpaste smell like fish and, mercifully, shit doesn\u2019t stink at all. Apart from the latter, all bad news. Sometimes, I get one glorious accurate sniff of something before it disappears. It\u2019s as if my olfactory receptors wake up to the novelty of a scent, but immediately become bored and go back to sleep. If I cut open an orange, I\u2019ll get a floral, citrus hit on the first inhale \u2013 oh my God, my nose has returned! But when I take another whiff, I get nothing back. On a call with Carl Philpott , professor of rhinology and olfactology at the University of East Anglia, I start with the obvious. What is smell? \u201cSmell,\u201d says Philpott, \u201cis a chemo-sensory perception, which allows us to detect odours in the world around us, as a source of enjoyment and pleasure, but also as a hazard warning.\u201d Where once my nose was the first responder, it now fails to detect dangers. I once left a moka coffee pot on the hob for so long that the plastic handle completely melted off along with the rubber gasket between the chambers. I was in the living room at the time when a neighbour knocked on the door to check what on earth was going on. He could smell the asphyxiating fumes from next door. In better times I\u2019d have smelled brewing coffee as soon as it started to bubble. God knows what toxic fumes I\u2019m not smelling. Stale milk detection: useless. Noses off: Rudi Zygadlo contemplates another flavourless meal. Photograph: Photograph Martina Lang/Paper artist Sinem Erkas Professor Philpott confirms how common accidents like the molten coffee pot are, and how, \u201cwithout smell, we are forced to rely on visual clues for danger\u201d. As he explains, \u201cWe use smell in one of two ways \u2013 orthonasal olfaction, smelling stuff from the outside when air comes through the front of the nose, and retronasal olfaction, when the air travels backwards through the nose and we essentially breath out the smell of the food we are eating.\u201d Either way, odour particles reach the olfactory epithelium, at the top of the nose, where the specialised receptor cells live.\u201d The nerves travel from the receptors upwards through a bone called the cribriform plate and into the olfactory bulb at the bottom of the brain. Philpott describes this as a \u201crelay station\u201d that sends information on to the amygdala, the orbitofrontal cortex and the hippocampus. A 2023 study found that brain activity in anosmia sufferers is reduced and communication between these parts is impaired. With a healthy functioning olfactory system we can, according to a 2014 study into the resolution of the olfactory system, detect more than a trillion scents, \u201cfar outperforming the other senses in the number of physically different stimuli it can discriminate\u201d. Taste, on the other hand, is a fairly rudimentary sense. Because the experience of eating is drained of pleasure when people lose their sense of smell, they often believe they have lost their sense of taste, too. In fact the ability to taste is usually entirely intact. \u201cFrom a medical perspective,\u201d says Philpott, \u201ctaste is what we perceive on the tongue: salt, sweet, sour, bitter and umami. In the vast majority of anosmia cases this function is preserved. Most of the causes of loss of smell do not affect the taste receptors.\u201d It\u2019s true, a spoonful of salt still packs the same punch. But the complexity and pleasure of eating predominantly comes from our sophisticated smell apparatus. Conclusion: you don\u2019t know what taste really is until you lose your sense of smell and your tongue is left to fend for itself. The ruination of food \u2013 and newfound ways to cope \u2013 may be the most widely discussed aspect of anosmia. My fellow-afflicted friend, Megan, said she became \u201cabsolutely obsessed with crunchy food\u201d because texture became so important. \u201cPorridge: a no-go.\u201d Agreed. When I had absolutely no smell at all, I found myself drawn to spicy crisps as a kind of sensory compensation. Tejal Rao , a food critic for the New York Times , lamented that, \u201cCheese became rubber and paste. Popcorn turned into thorny foam.\u201d In her anosmic state, Rao found solace in a Sichuan seasoning called mala which, thanks to a special molecular compound, \u201cyou experience as a buzzing current through your mouth and lips\u201d. You can get a sight and hearing test on the high street. So why not a quick smell test, too? And some consumables are all nose! Wine, for instance. We used to have a lot of fun with it, my partner and I. It was a highlight of the first lockdown bubble. \u201cHose-pipe rubber; armpit sweat; my gran\u2019s closet\u2026\u201d the usual stuff. She would go further. \u201cThere\u2019s an elasticity about this chianti.\u201d I always thought she was being a bit fanciful, but she was defiant. \u201cYes. Elastic as opposed to tight.\u201d The bouquet and the high jinks disappeared with my smell. Imagine hugging the ghost of an old friend. You recognise it, you are primed for its embrace, but it has no substance. You fall through it, grasping for something to hold on to before it vanishes. As things have improved, the ghost has regained a little opacity. One hack I have discovered is that if you take a whiff of fresh (fishy) coffee grounds between sips of wine, you can trick your olfactory receptors into smelling the wine anew each time. Not a very elegant solution. Philpott tells me that loss can be caused variously by a physical blockage to the receptors (as in the case of rhinosinusitis); from viruses like Covid, which cause the receptor cells to become dysfunctional; from a head injury, which can damage any part of the olfactory equipment from the receptors through to the brain; or by certain neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson\u2019s, which can cause the equipment to fail, too. I fall into the second category. Duncan Boak, the founder of Fifth Sense , a charity dedicated to smell and taste disorders, is in the third. In 2005, he suffered a head injury which left him with complete anosmia. Initially he counted his blessings for having survived the accident and tried to move on from it, writing off his lost sense of smell, but over the next five years he found that the emotional bandwidth of his life was steadily narrowing. \u201cI became disconnected from the world around me,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThe places and memories that one relates to through smell became inaccessible. I even lost intimacy with my girlfriend. I lost something I didn\u2019t even know I had.\u201d There is a strong relationship between smell and memory. A 2023 study found that people may experience an impaired sense of smell before symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease appear. In the early days of my smell loss, my partner produced a small library of essential oils for me to practise \u201csmell training\u201d \u2013 a common anosmia treatment that involves deliberately and repeatedly smelling familiar odours to rebuild frayed connections between nose and brain. As I sniffed away, the scents were mostly faint and distorted, but there were a few I recognised. As I sniffed away, the scents were mostly faint and distorted, but there were a few I recognised One bottle smelled just awful though, like chemical faecal matter. When I was told what it was \u2013 lavender \u2013 I wept. It\u2019s my mother\u2019s favourite smell. She grew it in the garden and used to make lavender oil and lavender bags for the clothes drawers and under the pillows. On a holiday to Provence years ago I walked through an endless field of the purple flower. I learned that the word is derived from the Latin lava , meaning \u201cto wash\u201d. The flower was used by the Provencales to wash linen, which gave the washerwomen their name, lavandi\u00e8res . In the past, the fragrance alone would have evoked this emotional and memory-laden trivia. It stands to reason, then, that without access to the transportive power of smell, memory itself may dwindle. In 2011, Boak came across Molly Birnbaum\u2019s book Season to Taste , about her smell loss. \u201cIt was completely revelatory. More than a lightbulb moment. Imagine turning the lights on in an aircraft hangar. Everything bursting into light.\u201d Having avoided dwelling on his disorder for five years, he finally realised his inability to smell was the root of his desolation. He also realised he was not alone. Through Birnbaum\u2019s book, Boak started connecting with fellow sufferers and experts like Professor Philpott and he saw that there was a desperate need for an organisation to provide support and raise awareness of the disorder. Motivated, too, by a determination to transform \u201cthe most negative experience of his life into a positive one\u201d, he set up Fifth Sense. On the website, you can find your nearest regional Fifth Sense support hub, see the latest research and treatment and read stories from sufferers. \u201cCreating a sense of community is absolutely paramount,\u201d says Boak. \u201cWhen you are cut off from so many of life\u2019s pleasures, sharing this stuff really helps. It reduces the sense of isolation.\u201d I\u2019ve always had a Groucho Marx attitude toward club- membership, but I must admit that comparing notes with Boak has been comforting; there\u2019s even something of the gallows humour to be found in sharing. As well as the comparable emotional stuff, he too had an oven-related near-miss; he left the gas on in the oven all night, had a cigarette in his mouth and was poised to light it before deciding to smoke outside. Moments later, his flatmate informed him of the leak. (Gas safety is high on the agenda for the charity.) Philpott meanwhile assured me that weird-smelling coffee and toothpaste are common distortions, known as parosmia. Though I\u2019m not the severest of cases, I do appreciate this sense of kinship, knowing others go through similar experiences, especially since, as Boak is keen to emphasise, smell is the most overlooked and understudied of all the senses. \u201cYou can walk down the high street and get a sight and hearing test from Specsavers.\u201d Why not a quick smell test? Instituting nationwide smell screening is one of Fifth Sense\u2019s primary goals. For many medical reasons, from hazard perception and mental health issues to neurodegenerative diseases, smell loss is linked to early mortality, so the sooner it is detected the better. Weird-smelling coffee and toothpaste are common distortions, known as parosmia Odd, how losing something can actually bring it into focus. Not that I\u2019m an expert, but I wouldn\u2019t know what an olfactory bulb was if mine actually worked. And then there\u2019s the newfound gratitude. It\u2019s a theme running through my research like a Joni Mitchell song , that you don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve got until it\u2019s gone. I ask Boak, if he could turn back time, avoid the accident and get his smell back, would he? \u201cNo,\u201d he replies, before composing himself. \u201cNo. Whilst there are still very difficult things about the condition, on the flip side, I\u2019d have never become this passionate about something or started a charity.\u201d So what about treatments? I ask Philpott. \u201cSinus disease, which is the most common cause of smell loss, has numerous established treatments,\u201d he says. \u201cSmell loss caused by viruses like Covid is an area with a much greater need for treatment development, though there are various medications that have not been taken through the gold standard of a random controlled trial.\u201d There is some, albeit weak, evidence for drugs such as theophylline (an asthma drug) and sodium citrate (a kind of buffer solution sprayed into the nose). In the last few years, people have also received \u201cplasma-rich protein injections\u201d into the nose. Philpott is particularly sceptical about this. The efficacy is inconclusive: it\u2019s a \u201cresource-hungry\u201d process involving \u201csubstrates\u201d and needles. No thanks. \u201cThere is some interesting research going on in the US in terms of stem cell treatment, which may cause a reactivation of smell receptors,\u201d says Philpott, who is on his way to Geneva for a conference on olfactory implants. \u201cIn the same way that a cochlear implant can restore hearing, in theory a device could be implanted, perhaps under the skin of the forehead, with a wire running to the olfactory bulb with an electrical stimulus.\u201d Sign me up. \u201cStill a long way to go\u2026\u201d he says. And then there\u2019s smell training. \u201cThere is some evidence to support it, but it doesn\u2019t work for everyone,\u201d says the professor. After my lachrymose lavender sessions in early 2021, I gave up on the exercise \u2013 it was too depressing. Like Boak, I didn\u2019t want to dwell on my disorder. But while writing this piece over the last couple of weeks, I\u2019ve had the essential oils lined up on my desk to dip into a couple of times a day. I can\u2019t smell jasmine, sandalwood or pine, but lemon verbena makes my eyes well with joy. On a freezing December morning, I\u2019m in London to have my photo taken. After the shoot, the photographer, who had read an early draft of the piece, tells me she has a present for me. \u201cI\u2019m told lavender tastes like it smells,\u201d she says, handing me a bar of paper-wrapped chocolate. It\u2019s a gesture worthy of a Dickens novel and, of course, as per my magnanimity, I do not mention the discoveries of my recent research: that what one might think of as the taste of lavender probably is its smell. Bah humbug. When I get home I eat a piece. The bitterness of the chocolate overwhelms all else. But I have a second piece. And another. And then, an aroma like a spectre. It\u2019s there, lavender, like it ought to be. Faint but powerful in its evocations, stimulating the hippocampus, bringing Provence and scented pillows into focus, counterpointing the sharpness of the cacao on my tongue like some benign floral ghost. \u201cI live in the past, the present and the future!\u201d",

        "content": "S omething glowing in a glass, a delicious morsel of homemade food and I am a happy guest. But on the whole I prefer being the host; greeting someone at the door and getting them a drink and passing round plates of simple handmade snacks is something to relish. Welcome though a cocktail is, the food is always what people remember. An element of crispness is vital. A crumbly biscuit of parmesan freckled with black sesame seeds; a diminutive potato cake, its edges crisp and warm from the frying pan. And, in the case of something sweet to eat, a crackle-crusted almond cookie, its core chewy as fudge, will work a treat. To make life a little easier, I offer just one or two cocktails with a back-up for those who find such drinks an anathema. A mulled cider will spread cheer and work nicely with cheese wafers or potato pancakes, which I will top with crisp curls of sauerkraut or pickled cabbage. For the almond cookies there will be a mimosa of pomegranate and sparkling wine as pretty as a fairy light. Mulled cider with potato cakes If, like me, you rather enjoy the idea of being in the kitchen while your guests make merry, then these light, crisp fritters are for you. I don\u2019t advise you to make them in advance, they are a spur-of-the-moment thing. The quicker they go from pan to plate the better. Makes 12 For the potato cakes: potatoes 750g onion 1, medium garlic 1 clove plain flour 4 tbsp eggs 2 vegetable oil a little, for frying ruby coleslaw or pickled cabbage 12 tsp poppy seeds 1 tsp Peel and finely grate the potatoes. Peel the onion and grate or slice as finely as you can, then add it to the potatoes. Season with half a teaspoon of salt then transfer to a colander or fine sieve and set aside over a bowl or plate for 15 minutes. Peel and crush the garlic to a paste. Squeeze the potato mixture in your hands to remove any excess liquid, then place in a mixing bowl and stir in the crushed garlic and the flour. Season with a little black pepper. Break the eggs into a small bowl or cup, beat briefly with a fork, then stir into the potato. Warm a thin layer of oil in a shallow, nonstick pan. Divide the mixture into 12 and pat them into small flat cakes. Lower them, a few at a time, into the hot oil and let them fry for about 5 minutes on each side, turning them with a palette knife. They should be pale gold in colour and lightly crisp. Remove from the pan and drain briefly on kitchen paper. Top each with a teaspoon of coleslaw or pickled cabbage and sprinkle with poppy seeds. The quicker these are eaten the better. For the cider: cider 1 litre apple juice 500ml brandy 80ml soft brown sugar 50g (to taste) orange 1 star anise 2 cloves 4 cinnamon stick 3 Pour the cider, apple juice and brandy into a stainless-steel saucepan and warm over a moderate heat. Stir in the sugar. Remove 2 or 3 long strips of peel from the orange and drop them into the pan, then scatter in the star anise, cloves and cinnamon sticks. Bring the mixture almost to the boil, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. The overall flavour should be spicy and appley rather than taste too strongly of brandy. Taste and adjust the sugar as pleases you, introducing more brandy if you wish. Ladle into glasses. Crisp spiced cheese biscuits Something else to serve with the mulled cider, or indeed any drink you may offer this Christmas . Enough for about 8 guests For the biscuits: plain flour 100g Aleppo pepper 1 tsp butter 75g, cold egg yolk 1 parmesan 50g, finely grated black sesame seeds 1 tsp You will also need a baking sheet lined with baking parchment Season the flour with the Aleppo pepper and a grinding of black pepper. Cut the butter into small pieces and rub into the flour with your fingertips. (You can do this with a food processor if you prefer.) Break the egg yolk into the crumbs of flour and butter and add the grated parmesan and black sesame seeds, stirring with a fork. On a lightly floured pastry board or work surface, bring the dough together into a ball. Using a floured rolling pin, roll the dough into a rectangle roughly 23cm x 17cm and as thick as a couple of \u00a31 coins one on top of the other. Tear or cut the dough into pieces roughly 4cm x 6cm. Keep the shapes quite random, placing them on the lined baking sheet. Chill for 20 minutes, then preheat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4 and bake the biscuits for about 15 minutes until crisp and golden. Leave the biscuits in place on the tray for 5 minutes before carefully transferring to a cooling rack using a palette knife. Pomegranate mimosa and orange almond cookies \u2018Most charming when warm and gooey\u2019: orange almond cookies and pomegranate mimosa. Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The Observer Makes 16 For the cookies: egg whites 2 caster sugar 190g ground almonds 285g almond extract 1 or 2 drops orange zest finely grated icing sugar 80g and more for dusting You will also need a baking sheet lined with baking parchment Put the egg whites in a scrupulously clean mixing bowl, making sure there is no trace of egg yolk among them. (It will prevent them from stiffening.) Whisk until they are loose and frothy, then add the caster sugar and beat until thick, firm and glossy \u2013 the mixture should be able to stand in peaks. This can take quite a while. Stir in the ground almonds and the almond extract \u2013 be careful not to add too much, the flavour can be very intense. Stir in the orange zest. Roll the mixture into balls, about 40g in weight. Put the icing sugar in a shallow tray or bowl, then roll the amaretti in the sugar. Leave, covered in the sugar, for 10 minutes, then put them on a baking sheet and dust them generously with more icing sugar. Bake in a preheated 180C oven for 12 minutes until ivory in colour. They should feel lightly crisp outside, soft and giving within and their crusts should be cracked. Set aside on a cooling rack \u2013 though they are at their most charming when still warm and slightly gooey within. For the pomegranate mimosa Serves 4 fresh pomegranate juice 80ml sparkling wine 320ml Pour the pomegranate juice into glasses and top up with the sparkling wine.

Seeing this master film-maker visibly grapple with the limits of artistic expression took my breath away. Jesse Hassenger The sexual assault \u2013 Fair Play Photograph: Courtesy of Netflix There are several tense, memorable moments in Fair Play, the Sundance breakout unfairly dumped on Netflix this fall \u2013 in the office of a ruthless hedge fund, where Emily and Luke, the lovers played by Phoebe Dynevor and Alden Ehrenreich, hide their forbidden relationship. In their apartment kitchen, where the couple\u2019s unevenness \u2013 Emily gets a fat promotion, Luke doesn\u2019t \u2013 curdles into increasingly sharp digs. And in the bathroom, where we first meet the couple in a pre-doom moment of carnal bliss: having ducked out of a family wedding for a quickie, Emily and Luke end up happily smeared in period blood, a ring on her finger. One male fragility-fueled implosion later, the two have once again escaped to a bathroom, this time at their engagement party. Ehrenreich and Dynevor are firing on all cylinders here, both brimming with a toxic soup of emotions: shame, love, desperation, fury, lust tinged with an overpowering flavor of disgust. What starts out as a consensual last contemptuous, rough fuck turns into something sinister, violent, final. I have thought about the moment when Luke\u2019s good guy mask falls, when Emily realizes her position and endures, all year. Adrian Horton The pigeon \u2013 Showing Up Photograph: Allyson Riggs/AP Lizzy (Michelle Williams) doesn\u2019t want a pet pigeon, particularly not an injured one palmed off on her by landlord and fellow artist Jo (Hong Chau). Kelly Reichardt\u2019s Showing Up is about the strained power imbalance between these friends and sometime creative rivals, who have very different approaches to life and art. Even though she\u2019s swamped in the run-up to an important show, Lizzy will take care of the bird with a broken wing when it is presented to her in a bucket hat, just like she takes care of her needy family with little protest beyond shallow breaths and flushed cheeks. I\u2019ll never forget the knot in my stomach when Jo turns up to Lizzy\u2019s private view of delicate ceramics with \u201cthis guy!\u201d \u2013 the bird \u2013 which, duh, doesn\u2019t stay put in its cardboard box for long. As the pigeon takes flight, Lizzy watches in dismay as her porcelain figures come within a wingspan of going the way of Linda Barker\u2019s teapots . In Reichardt\u2019s subtly observed film, it\u2019s the closest the director comes to cracking the lid of the pressure cooker. Owen Myers The town meeting \u2013 RMN Photograph: - It might seem a bit like cheating to designate a 17-minute scene as a \u201cmoment\u201d, not to mention a stretch to add \u201cof the year\u201d in referring to a proceeding so dry that most municipalities stick it on daytime public-access. But by capturing a contentious town meeting with a single static shot, the director Cristian Mungiu announces this bureaucratic showstopper as a discrete cinematic unit oriented around a cogent idea. He\u2019s described the shout-a-thon, packed with disgruntled residents of a Romanian village airing their xenophobic objections to the arrival of a few migrant workers, as a Tower of Babel in which what\u2019s being said (in several different languages) counts for less than the fact of everyone\u2019s inability to communicate. Even so, the dialogue nails the tenor and thought patterns of the type of aggrieved citizen that shows up for this kind of thing: the rigidity, the rage, the easy distraction, the palpable undercurrent of trembling fear. While a handful of this year\u2019s noteworthy festival debuts addressed Europe\u2019s immigration quagmire \u2013 Agnieszka Holland\u2019s Green Border, Ladj Ly\u2019s Les Ind\u00e9sirables, Matteo Garrone\u2019s Io Capitano \u2013 Mungiu condenses his broadside against intolerance into a tidy package of paradoxically gripping tedium. It plays like a soulless de-parodizing of Parks and Recreation. Charles Bramesco The reunion \u2013 Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Photograph: FlixPix/Alamy The Spider-Verse sequel is so bursting with spectacular sequences that splash across the screen, we barely have the time to process the awesomeness of one before we\u2019re barraged by another. That\u2019s partially why the moment that really stuck from Across the Spider-Verse is when time seems to stand still. Spider-Man (the Miles Morales one) and Spider-Gwen enjoy a fleeting romantic reunion at the Williamsburg Savings Bank. A giant clock is just below them (or above depending on your perspective) as they take a seat, upside down, hanging from a ledge, drinking in the water-coloured Manhattan skyline from a flipped perspective. It\u2019s a stunning shot, towering above most at the cinema this year. I couldn\u2019t help but savour the sexiness of it on first viewing, because this is a genre that tends to keep hormones zipped up. On return visits, the melancholy really hits. Here are two teen superheroes who have to tuck in their identities, isolated from their families and everyone around them. That image becomes one of yearning and loneliness in a crowded city, where New York with all its bustling activity, appears on a whole other axis, as distant as the other side of the spider-verse. Radheyan Simonpillai The fart \u2013 Dream Scenario Photograph: Landmark Media/Alamy When searching for a best movie moment of 2023, I wanted to choose something profound, a scene that spoke to the unending stream of horrors we stared down in 2023. But after racking my brain, all I could think of was a fart joke. In Dream Scenario, Nicolas Cage plays Paul Matthews, a hapless, mild-mannered college academic and family man who becomes an overnight sensation after nearly everyone in the world starts seeing him in their dreams. A hip influencer agency wants to take Paul as a client; when he meets the team, Molly, a gen Z assistant reveals she\u2019s been having sex fantasies about the professor. After some drinking and bad decision-making, Paul winds up in her apartment, playing out the dream. None of us want to see this \u2013 Paul is happily married to Janet, his adorable suburban mom wife. But he\u2019s high on power, awkwardly kissing a much younger woman who is less than impressed with the real-life tryst. It\u2019s a #MeToo nightmare unfolding. Just when Molly goes to unzip his pants, Paul accidentally breaks our unbearable tension with a tremendous, stock-soundtrack fart \u2026 and then another. Juvenile humor? Absolutely. But fitting, perhaps, for such a shit year. Alaina Demopoulos The pool \u2013 Origin Photograph: Atsushi Nishijima / NEON There are moments in Ava DuVernay\u2019s unusual, academic adaptation of Isabel Wilkerson\u2019s bestseller Caste when it\u2019s easier to admire the ambition rather than love the execution. But there are also moments when her leftfield decision to transform a non-fiction study into a narrative movie feels like the only way to convey the power of Wilkerson\u2019s argument, most effectively in a gut-punch of scene near the end. As Wilkerson, played by a commanding Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor, interviews an older man about a racist act of exclusion involving the one Black kid on his little league baseball team being denied entrance to a swimming pool, DuVernay takes us back and recreates the incident in all of its horror and heartache. It brings up all of the anger and sadness that such dehumanising bigotry should, with such force that it leaves us a little winded, and the piercing image of a terrified child being ferried around an empty pool on a lilo, after being told he can\u2019t touch the water, will haunt me for a while. Benjamin Lee The bar \u2013 Past Lives Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy In the third act of Past Lives, the playwright and debut director Celine Song finally brings us back to the sophisticated, emotionally precise movie\u2019s jumping off point, in which the South Korean protagonist, Na Young, her girlhood romance and her current American boyfriend are all sitting at a bar together feeling their way through a complicated encounter. The moment is pregnant with what hasn\u2019t been said, which Song has magisterially suggested over the past 70 minutes. It\u2019s right here, in a sequence that feels like a 21st-century version of some love-drenched French New Wave archetype, where this expertly observed film about everything that\u2019s hard to articulate about love reaches transcendence, giving us much more than what most movies are capable of. It\u2019s scenes like this that mark Song\u2019s sky-high potential. Veronica Esposito The diner \u2013 All of Us Strangers Photograph: Entertainment Pictures/Alamy I just gave up trying not to cry in the final 30-odd minutes of All of Us Strangers, Andrew Haigh\u2019s astonishing ghost story. One devastating scene follows another, meaning you finally stagger out in a state of almost transcendental upset. But perhaps the moment that sticks with me the most \u2013 and, like The Zone of Interest, this is a film your brain won\u2019t stop poring over \u2013 is the one in which Andrew Scott\u2019s parents take him to a diner for a treat. Of course, it\u2019s not quite what it seems: that American-style caff might have once existed at the top of the Whitgift centre in Croydon but it doesn\u2019t now (I\u2019ve checked). And, perhaps more crucially, his parents are dead, though miraculously still somehow as alive to him as they were on the day of their fateful car crash in 1987. All three know that their strange reunion, this peculiar grace from grief, is coming to an end. The mother (Claire Foy) wants to know if their deaths were quick. Her son lies: they were. And then the eyes of Foy and Jamie Bell, who plays Scott\u2019s dad, slowly change: they blacken, and their bodies stiffen. They have gone, and Scott is just sitting in a diner by himself, a single man approaching 50, as a waitress brings him a family platter. Anyone who\u2019s seen that astonishing ocular shift when someone dies will recognise it here, but I think that moment would destroy you anyway. I\u2019m tearing up just thinking about it. Catherine Shoard The confrontation \u2013 You Hurt My Feelings Photograph: FlixPix/Alamy Nicole Holofcener\u2019s achingly real comedy turns on a happy marriage thrown into turmoil when Beth (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), an author multiple drafts into her first novel, overhears her husband (Tobias Menzies) expressing his misgivings about the book to a friend. He felt it was his role to be supportive, so he\u2019d been cheering every revision. You Hurt My Feelings makes the complicated argument that candor is sometimes the best way to show support, a point that\u2019s reinforced in a terrific scene in which Beth\u2019s son (Owen Teague), a flailing barista of sorts at a cannabis dispensary, blasts her for it. Her recalls a time when she enrolled him in an advanced swim class when he could barely dog paddle, because she wanted the best for him. And now, as an adult, she presses him constantly for what will surely be his brilliant debut as a playwright. It\u2019s a lesson to parents everywhere: sometimes your encouragement can feel like an albatross. Scott Tobias The meeting \u2013 Father\u2019s Day Photograph: YouTube No documentary misted the eyes quite like Kirk Franklin\u2019s Father\u2019s Day. In a crisp half-hour, the gospel superstar takes the audience on a wild and raw journey to find his biological father \u2013 a man Franklin thought he had buried, only to discover his true DNA match had been living blocks away from his Dallas recording studio all along. Unforgettable as it was to watch Franklin\u2019s estranged mother deny the unassailable facts time and again in her son\u2019s pursuit of total closure, it\u2019s final scenes between the 53-year-old Franklin and his thirtysomething son Kerrion (the strained Franklin relationship that has been the most widely chronicled ) that pack the biggest emotional wallop. It\u2019s the kind of primal yet tender moment that isn\u2019t often captured between adult father and adult son, scripted or otherwise \u2013 and it had many grown-ass men on Black Twitter confessing to shedding real tears and delivering weepy on-camera reviews. But even those who aren\u2019t fans of the church or its music are liable to come away from Father\u2019s Day converted. Andrew Lawrence",

        "content": "Last week it was announced that Stephen Fry would be delivering this year\u2019s alternative Christmas message on Channel 4. What refreshing news. After all, it was only in 2008 that the Holocaust-denying, Jew-hating president of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, was given the platform . So to hear instead that Fry \u2013 a national treasure and a powerful campaigner on issues including gay rights and mental health \u2013 will be using this moment to raise awareness of the hatred and racism directed at Jewish people right now, is very welcome. Antisemitism has risen year on year but the events of recent months have shaken many of us to our core. It is unbelievable that today, 90 years after Hitler rose to power and almost 80 years since his antisemitic crimes were exposed to the world, we are seeing antisemitism reach levels that I have never witnessed before in my lifetime. At the same time we have seen a stark rise in Islamophobia, and many people are feeling isolated and frightened. And so much of the vitriol we have seen over recent months has taken place and been amplified on social media platforms. For us at the Holocaust Educational Trust , as in any modern organisation, social media has long given us opportunities to reach new audiences and to hold important conversations. Yet last month we took the unprecedented decision to turn off comments on a post on our X (formerly Twitter) account due to the sickening nature of the antisemitic responses we were receiving. Comments including \u201cHolocaust is fake zionist jews story and did not happened\u201d and \u201cno one believes jews lies anymore\u201d [sic]. In between the outright denial of the Holocaust were slogans: \u201cFrom the River to the Sea\u2026 Israehell will never be\u201d; \u201cKeep the world clean\u201d accompanied by an image of the star of David being thrown in the bin; and a comment about Hamas that said \u201cthey are freedom fighters fighting the occupiers\u2019s [sic] they have all of my support\u201d. These were all under a single post. Once we strip back the rhetoric, we see the same old hatred. Six million Jews were murdered by it You may assume that this was the response to something directly mentioning Israel, or the antisemitism that is continuing to grow at a rapid rate as a result of the conflict, but you would be mistaken. Rather, these were responses to a post marking the 85th anniversary of the arrival of Jewish children to safety in the UK on the Kindertransport . They were posted below a video of 93-year-old Vera Schaufeld MBE, who was recounting her own memories of leaving behind everything she knew in Czechoslovakia \u2013 including her family, who went on to be exterminated by the Nazis \u2013 and coming to a safe haven in the UK. This response to Schaufeld is sadly all too common at the moment. Since 7 October, Holocaust organisations have faced a huge surge in antisemitic rhetoric. The Auschwitz-Birkenau museum , which for years has posted pictures and names of the 1.1 million men, women and children murdered at the camp, recently posted a photograph of Naatje de Leeuw-Levie, a Dutch-Jewish woman who was deported to the camp. As the museum said in its post, she did not survive. Immediately a comment appeared underneath: \u201cNeither did thousands of Palestinians that was killed Auschwitz style\u201d. The museum has reported that it has lost more than 6,000 followers since 7 October, raising the question why remembering the Holocaust might feel at odds to people who want to support the Palestinian cause. And it is not just institutions. I can personally attest that individuals who speak out about the Holocaust or antisemitism receive sickening abuse daily. My own social media responses since 7 October have made grim reading. Yet, heaven forbid that I speak out against it \u2013 if anything, me raising the deeply antisemitic responses that I receive daily online will only fuel the fire, proving that I am \u201cplaying the victim card\u201d, \u201cusing\u201d the Holocaust, or claiming antisemitism to deflect legitimate criticism of Israel. There are countless commenters who respond to everything that I post to claim that Israel or Zionism are equivalent to the Nazis. That the Jewish state is now conducting its own \u201cfinal solution\u201d \u2013 the Nazi euphemism for the murder of 6 million Jewish men, women and children \u2013 against the Palestinians. These are all examples of Holocaust inversion, presenting the Jewish people, whom the Nazis attempted to exterminate, as the modern-day equivalent. This is just a very small insight into antisemitism on social media today and the problem itself is much greater. Even when posts are reported, the social media companies are unlikely to act. A recent report from the Center for Countering Digital Hate found that X continued hosting 99% of posts that CCDH\u2019s researchers reported for promoting hate speech, including antisemitism. History and facts are being replaced by emotion and a sense of righteousness And the spread of these antisemitic conspiracies is already having a harmful effect. A recent study published in the Economist found that one in five Americans aged 18-29 believe the Holocaust to be a myth. A different survey found that nearly a quarter of Dutch people born after 1980 similarly believe it to be a myth or the number of its victims to be greatly exaggerated. Antisemitism is now on a level not seen since the Holocaust. Since 7 October, public discourse feels futile, even impossible. Fuelled by social media, individuals are being forced to pick a side as if this were a football match. History and facts are being replaced by emotion and a sense of righteousness. Calling out antisemitism or posting a video of Holocaust survivors sharing their testimony is now claimed to be taking a side and so ignorantly and hatefully attacked. If you have not seen the reaction to Stephen Fry, take a look . It is true that you can be appalled by the scenes that we are witnessing in Gaza and critical of the choices made by the Israeli government, and not be an antisemite. But if anyone still wonders whether the hatred we are seeing is really antisemitism, or just legitimate criticism of a nation state, they need look no further. Once we strip back the rhetoric, we see the same old hatred. People like Vera Schaufeld lived through it once. People like 27-year-old Naatje de Leeuw-Levie were murdered by it. Let us not be fooled just because it is dressed up with new names and new politics. Anti-Jewish hate is on the march, and this time the world must not turn its back. Let us all make it our new year resolution to finally stamp out antisemitism, Islamophobia and hate. Let\u2019s make 2024 the year when we finally find a cure for this poison.

Every time we get celebrities on, we\u2019re surprised by how naturally they take to it. After a couple of hours, they come out of their shells and get quite personal about what they\u2019re making. No spoilers but there\u2019s a Christmas miracle. One of them has truly brilliant aptitude. I was so impressed. Which celebrity would you most like to see on the show? Brad Pitt. He\u2019s watched every season. Last summer, I was in a field in Wales for the Eisteddfod and randomly got a phone call from Universal Pictures, saying: \u201cBrad Pitt\u2019s a big fan of yours, we\u2019d love it if you could do a personal message to him.\u201d They played it to him on the red carpet, which was surreal. Ryan Reynolds is a fan too. The celebrity potters see it as a badge of honour to make you cry. Do you mind that? It\u2019s better than a Paul Hollywood handshake! Often I get asked, are you on drugs? Is it contrived? It\u2019s neither. I can\u2019t make myself cry, it\u2019s genuine. When you see someone so personally invested in what they\u2019ve made, I can\u2019t help but feel a connection. If I was a weedy bloke crying on telly, maybe it\u2019d get a different reaction. But because I look like a bricklayer, people take notice. I\u2019ll walk past a building site and blokes shout: \u201cOi, love your crying on TV!\u201d You wouldn\u2019t believe how many messages I get from men in the forces who say: \u201cWell done, mate, it\u2019s great not to be shy about showing your emotions.\u201d More power to us crying men! The Festive Pottery Throw Down (l-r): Joe Swash, Alice Levine, Rich Miller, Keith Brymer Jones, Siobh\u00e1n McSweeney, Hugh Dennis and Sophie Duker. Photograph: Mark Bourdillon/Channel 4 Then there\u2019s nasty Keith with his rejects bucket. Is that to redress the balance? The bucket of doom! There you go, I\u2019m full of contradictions. I take the craft very seriously. You have to be ruthless with yourself to learn. When I was an apprentice, I had to throw 100 balls of clay at the end of each day. My boss would come along with a ruler and chop them in half if they were no good. Eventually more stayed than went in the bin. That\u2019s when I knew I was getting somewhere. The new series starts in January. Is the standard of amateur potters getting better each year? I can\u2019t\u2026 I\u2019ll start crying. Honestly, mate, it\u2019s unbelievable. We\u2019ve had some incredible makes this year. And a lot of me bloody crying! Has there been a Pottery Throw Down effect, with increased interest in pottery? Everyone\u2019s doing it now. This year\u2019s potters range in age from 24 to 67, from all walks of life. The wonder of it is that people are starting to use their hands again. Clay is such a wonderfully expressive material. You can make anything with it. Having thumbs makes us humans incredibly dextrous. We can express ourselves through clay. Was your attraction to clay a result of your dyslexia? Absolutely. It\u2019s just a different way of looking at the world. Back in the 80s, if you had dyslexia, you were just considered thick, but you have a much better affinity to shape, form and volume. The first moment I touched clay was age 11, in my first year of secondary school. I just took to it. What would you have been if you weren\u2019t a potter? Was there ever a plan B? Prison maybe? I was very good at technical drawing, so maybe an architect. Again, that taps into the dyslexia. Many architects are dyslexic. It\u2019s that affinity for 3D objects. I met Shane MacGowan in Dingwalls when his front teeth had just been knocked out. Lo and behold, it became his trademark I hear you were also a dancer? From age three to 18, I did ballet, tap, Highland and Scottish country. It taught me physical discipline, which I\u2019m sure helped my pottery career. Would you be interested if Strictly came calling? Yeah, just to lose a bit of weight if nothing else! Dance is a wonderful thing for mind and body. But because I used to do it fairly well, I\u2019d be very harsh on myself. My body won\u2019t function the way it did when I was 15. Tell us about your punk days. What sort of frontman were you? A total nutter. We used to play lots of London venues with bands like Blur and Pulp supporting us. Before I went on stage, I\u2019d have a pint of milk, a pint of lager and a bag of chips. That got my larynx in good check, then anything goes on stage. At one Camden Palace gig, I climbed up the PA stack, launched myself off and landed on my knees. Obviously the show must go on but after the gig, my jeans had to be cut off because my knees were so swollen. It was a great university of life. Didn\u2019t Shane MacGowan used to take money on the door at your gigs? God yeah, the lovely Shane. He was in a band called the Nips way back when and also worked in record shops, so we crossed paths a lot. We\u2019d knock around in a Camden gang. I remember meeting Shane in Dingwalls when his front teeth had just been knocked out in a fight. Lo and behold, it became his trademark. Did punk influence your work? I did a whole punk range. I have a punk attitude to anything I do. That spirit of \u201cfuck \u2019em and their law\u201d is my mantra in life. The Prodigy have a song to that effect. I saw them recently at Ally Pally. You have sharp dress sense. Are clothes important to you? They are. Half the clothes I wear on the show are my own. I love well-made clothes and try to promote British labels. I\u2019m always wearing HebTroCo jeans with Grenson or Church\u2019s shoes. What does 2024 hold? A big move to north Wales. We\u2019ve bought this former Presbyterian chapel \u2013 real fire and brimstone stuff \u2013 in Pwllheli. I couldn\u2019t even pronounce the town\u2019s name at first. We wanted something that wasn\u2019t a house, so we were looking at old libraries, petrol stations, cinemas, anything. Then I came across this place. We\u2019re renovating it to be a combined living space, studio and community hall. I\u2019d like to be making my first pots there by June. This issue is our puzzles special. Do you enjoy quizzes? I love a pub quiz. Marj is pretty good and I know lots of useless bits of information. Our regular team name is Satan\u2019s Dream. What are your Christmas plans? We\u2019re up on the Isle of Bute, where Marj\u2019s family come from. Then we\u2019ll drive further north to Oban to visit my sister and spend new year there. It\u2019ll be a bit of a road trip but Scotland\u2019s a beautiful place to spend the festive period. We\u2019ll listen to Fairytale of New York and raise a toast to Shane. What\u2019s on your Christmas list? I think Marj has got me a roll-top Finisterre bag. It\u2019s waterproof so I can use it when I go sea swimming. We might even go for a bracing morning dip in Oban on New Year\u2019s Day. Start 2024 off right. Are there special Christmas ceramics that come out each year? Funny you should say that. We always put the turkey on my grandmother\u2019s old oval plate. It\u2019s very old and was made in Stoke, where we film Throw Down . It\u2019s wonderful how objects become so personal and valuable to you. You\u2019ll set me off crying again! The Festive Pottery Throw Down airs on Christmas Day at 7.30pm on Channel 4. The new series starts on Sunday 7 January",

        "content": "10. Ale Hop and Laura Robles \u2013 Agua Dulce Peru\u2019s Laura Robles and Ale Hop explore the radical history of the caj\u00f3n on their fiercely unusual debut album. Processing the box-shaped percussion instrument through fuzzing distortion and heavy reverb, while adding elements of synth bass and squeaking electronics, they lend Afro-Peruvian folk rhythms established during slavery a modern, industrial twist. Often unpredictable and on the verge of sudden collapse, the nine tracks on Agua Dulce push the caj\u00f3n into unchartered and exciting territory, proving its power and versatility far beyond the gentle acoustic jam sessions where it\u2019s often found. Read the full review Fiercely unusual \u2026 Laura Robles and Ale Hop. Photograph: Kasia Zacharko 9. Dragonchild \u2013 Dragonchild The debut solo album from DA Mekonnen, saxophonist and former member of Ethiopian group Debo Band, channels the keening melodies of Ethiojazz luminaries Mulatu Astatke and Hailu Mergia into a genre-hopping electronic blend. Tracks such as Sera skitter into amapiano territory, layering Mekonnen\u2019s sax over a looped mid-tempo beat, while The Source speeds into electro drums, Unicode 1200 pairs bright synths with programmed percussion and highlight LTD chops competing saxophone melodies together to create an interweaving afrobeat fanfare. As Dragonchild, Mekonnen showcases a production style and instrumental mastery that sits perfectly between the experimental and the accessible. 8. Balimaya Project \u2013 When the Dust Settles Since the release of their debut album in 2021, sprawling west African percussion ensemble Balimaya Project have built a reputation for fierce live shows that produce a barrage of complex rhythms. On their second record, they also prove themselves to be a formidable studio group, capable of moving listeners to introspection as much as joy. Inspired by bandleader Yahael Camara Onono\u2019s grief over the death of his brother, tracks like Suley\u2019s Ablution and A Prayer for Our Parents play as suites of complex mood music, traversing everything from orchestral strings to plaintive melodies and polyrhythms. 7. Ali Sethi and Nicolas Jaar \u2013 Intiha Pakistani singer Ali Sethi lends his gorgeously delicate voice to this fascinating remix album, sampling loops and sections of producer Nicolas Jaar\u2019s 2020 record Telas as the musical foundations for his songs of Urdu ghazal poetry. Largely transforming the typically full-throated form of ghazals into downtempo, ambient electronic productions, Sethi\u2019s vocals take on a breathy intimacy on tracks such as Nazar Se and Dard, drawing the listener into his intricate melodies. Jaar\u2019s productions, meanwhile, keep the tracks from slipping into monotony with their jarring hums of distortion and whispers of percussion. 6. EABS and Jaubi \u2013 In Search of a Better Tomorrow Pakistani improvisational quartet Jaubi\u2019s follow-up to their 2021 breakthrough raga jazz record Nafs at Peace packs a punch. Joining forces with Polish jazz group EABS, this new formation produces 10 tracks of Indian classical instrumentation combined with squealing saxophones and eerie synth textures to create an often explosive free-jazz freakout. Stringed sarangi melodies pair perfectly with the saxophone and thundering bass synth lines add a weighty foundation to the tabla, lending each composition a propulsive groove that anchors soaring solos. The album showcases Jaubi as a group capable of applying their instrumental traditions to experimental settings. Joyous and surprising \u2026 Thandi Ntuli. Photograph: Andile Buka 5. Thandi Ntuli with Carlos Ni\u00f1o \u2013 Rainbow Revisited South African pianist and vocalist Thandi Ntuli strips her sound back to its bare essentials on her third album and proves the potential of simply pairing piano with voice. With production and additional hints of experimental percussion from LA instrumentalist Carlos Ni\u00f1o, Ntuli\u2019s piano playing trips through lively fragmented phrases to plaintive, fine-tuned melodies, while her wordless vocalisations are eloquently emotive. It is a gently joyous, surprising record from a contemporary South African jazz scene that otherwise revels in the collective power of large ensemble playing. Read the full review 4. Deena Abdelwahed \u2013 Jbal Rrsas The Tunisian producer and DJ Deena Abdelwahed harnesses a monumental sound on her second album. Following her 2018 debut Khonnar, on which she added techno kick drums, mutant bass sounds and melodic electronics to styles such as Egyptian mahraganat and dabke folk rhythms, Abdelwahed continues to recontextualise music from the Arab world for the dancefloor. Across these seven tracks, she gets ever darker, wielding thundering synths and distorted, layered beats to precise effect, reaching a peak on the six-minute rhythmic odyssey of Violence for Free.

Photograph: Hanne Kaunicnik/\u00a92023 Squama 3. Enji \u2013 Ulaan Ulaanbaatar-born singer Enji\u2019s third record cements her distinct vision of Mongolian jazz. Combining the ceremonial long song \u2013 where syllables are drawn out to create elongated, melismatic lines of melody \u2013 with acoustic jazz instrumentation and short, sharp scat voicings, Ulaan plunges engaging depths despite the soft vibrato of Enji\u2019s voice. She\u2019s accompanied only by clarinet and bass on tracks such as Temeen Deerees Naran Oirhon and Vogl, and a downtempo jazz quartet on the Latin-influenced Taivshral, all working to create a spacious new environment for a centuries-old vocal tradition. Read the full review \u2018Doubt is exciting\u2019: cellist Mabe Fratti on chaos, curiosity and climbing volcanoes Read more 2. Titanic \u2013 Vidrio Mabe Fratti\u2019s latest project sees the Guatemala-born cellist and singer continue to adapt her songwriting process and step into newly collaborative territory. Partnering with multi-instrumentalist Hector Tosta, Vidrio does away with Fratti\u2019s typically folk-influenced genre conventions and instead traverses everything from jazz on Hotel Elizabeth to chamber pop on Cielo Falso and the screeching free improvisations of Balanza. Fratti and Tosta find their ideal blend on the anthemic thump of An\u00f3nima, layering a reverb-laden drum groove and doubled cello line with Fratti\u2019s catchy refrain. Always experimental without becoming obtrusive, Fratti and Tosta produce a beguiling, singular record. Read the full review 1. Arooj Aftab, Vijay Iyer and Shahzad Ismaily \u2013 Love in Exile Nothing has come close in 2023 to the skill and sheer absorption of this collaboration between singer Arooj Aftab, jazz pianist Vijay Iyer and producer and multi-instrumentalist Shahzad Ismaily. Often playing so quietly and with such minimal instrumentation as to be barely audible at all, Love in Exile is a masterclass in crafting deeply affecting arrangements with only voice, keys and bass. Aftab\u2019s vocals shine against such sparse backing, entering the frame often minutes into lengthy compositions and almost shocking in its breathy intimacy, while Iyer and Ismaily\u2019s instrumental dialogue bolsters her melodies without competing for attention. A small, slight and expertly crafted album of beauty. Read the full review",

        "content": "A s advent gathers pace, I tick off the days with a family ritual: monitoring the physical condition of a relative who is a medical professional, and whose years of service at the laboratory bench have left her with a predisposition to aching joints that, on occasion, render her unable to participate in physical tasks. It seems to worsen in December and, by the big day itself, she is fully constrained by the affliction that has come to be known in our household as Christmas Paw. She is to be excused from the tasks of fetching the wood in, loading the dishwasher and lugging presents from car to tree. A few eggnogs in, I have been known to remark acidly that it doesn\u2019t seem to hamper her enthusiasm for passing the port \u2013 to herself. But perhaps she knows whereof she malingers. Surveying accounts of the risks of entering into the seasonal spirit too blithely, I come to understand that sitting very still may be the best course of action. Among woeful warnings against dropping a frozen turkey on your foot, upending scalding tea on your lap and detaching your retina with a flying champagne cork , one stands out: penile fractures sustained in the course of unrestrained festive love-making. Too many thoughts occur, chief among them being \u2013 where do they find the time, the energy or, indeed, a quiet space in a house thronged with ingrates baying for mince pies and board games? God! Rest Ye, Merry Gentlemen. It is nonetheless inarguable that many a domestic Christmas Day can resemble one of those opening scenes of Casualty , in which a vicar is at the top of stepladder trying to change a lightbulb with a chainsaw while his elderly parishioner dangles a toaster over the fishtank. My worst seasonal injury befell me when I was momentarily distracted from the mandoline while slicing potatoes for dauphinoise: in the time-honoured ways of the professional martyr, I simply swathed my hand in a tea towel and hosed the blood off the spuds. If you too are the chief cook and bottle-washer, you will know that the most serious threats are to your emotional health: festering resentment, rampant passive aggression and a particularly heady concoction of self-pity and self-loathing. I stand by my well-tested remedy: Baileys in your coffee and as much HRT as your prescription will allow. This week, during the mammoth big shop, I witnessed a small boy cannon into a gondola end of cans of squirty cream, which skittered across the shiny floor like so many broken promises. Perhaps mindful of the naughty list, he faithfully set to picking them all up and rebuilding the colossal dairy pyramid, and only those passing close by could hear him sigh, \u201cWhy do I have to do everything?\u201d Little fella, I hear you. So a word of comfort to those wielding a tiny screwdriver to insert a battery into a child\u2019s toy, everyone mopping up a pool of cooling cat sick, the assemblers of flat-pack trestle tables and blowers-up of airbeds: this too shall pass. For guests, remember the cardinal rules: take the bins out and do not teeter on the edge of the kitchen telling the cook that \u201cit\u2019s just a big roast dinner, really\u201d. And amorous chaps, please, for the love of all that is holy: put your peckers away. Alex Clarke is an Observer columnist",

With that out of the way, let me tell you where you find me; slumped and groggy at my desk, putting the finishing touches to the letters from Santa I write each year to my nieces and nephews (hereafter referred to as niblings). This is my 10th year writing them. When I started, I had no kids myself, and eight niblings. I now have 18 of the latter, and two kids of my own. Moreover, back in 2014, I was temping in a dead-end office job with very little outlet for creativity, and the letters provided a life-saving salve to the drudge of spreadsheets and team meetings. Now, I sit resplendent within the literary and media elite \u2013 in the past six years alone, two whole people have stopped me in the street to say hello \u2013 so this annual mission finds me sapped of energy and face-to-face with a much more demanding audience. Luckily, they\u2019re my favourite bit of writing I do each year. For one thing, they\u2019ve established a tradition of me receiving letters to Santa from my favourite people. Age and distance means I see these kids less and less, so it\u2019s great to see what they\u2019ve been up to all year, to learn that they\u2019ve been mostly good, and discern from their list of presents what\u2019s going on in their psyches. That and the knowledge that ripped denim flares are back in fashion \u2013 who knew? Receiving these also makes Santa a surprisingly easy character to perform. His pleasingly forgetful, scatty manner pairs excellently with my mental state each December. This year, he writes, it\u2019s gotten so cold that the elves\u2019 words freeze in their mouths and have to be heated over a stove for their conversation to be audible. He gives updates on the status of their requested presents, some snazzy stickers and a cutaway diagram of Santa\u2019s Arctic Fortress, which may or may not be based on the Times \u2019s infamously speculative 2001 diagram of Osama bin Laden\u2019s Tora Bora terror base. It wouldn\u2019t be a useful bit of children\u2019s literature, without something for their cynical, blackhearted parents. There is, of course, a melancholy air to writing these, year on year. Within the 20 kids to whom these letters are addressed, I would class seven as true believers, and five as too young to know. The others are those who\u2019ve, shall we say, fallen off the Santa wagon (sleigh?) and no longer write their letters with the same conviction. Gone are the gushing, personalised letters to St Nick, replaced now by starkly functional gift itineraries, penned with the dead-eyed clarity of an expenses invoice. Their numbers will only increase as the years go on, but I don\u2019t dwell on it. I\u2019m too busy making sure I don\u2019t forget anyone. I\u2019ve made a list here somewhere, I\u2019m off to check it twice. Did Ye Hear Mammy Died? by S\u00e9amas O\u2019Reilly is out now (Little, Brown, \u00a316.99).

She was born on Christmas Eve 63 years ago and owes her first name to that date. \u201cPeople going, \u2018What\u2019s your favourite Christmas carol?\u2019\u201d she says, with an indulging eye roll. \u201cAll the jokes come out.\u201d But Vorderman has always loved this time of year, especially in her 30s, when she was married to the management consultant Patrick King (they separated in 2000) with whom she has two children. \u201cI would always go over the top for Christmas,\u201d she recalls. \u201cWhen the kids were very small, we\u2019d have five Christmas trees and around one Christmas tree there was a train set that would go through different rooms and make these ding-ding sounds. There wasn\u2019t a thing in the house that didn\u2019t sing: you know, that cactus that would sing or the Santa Claus that would sing. Yeah, I absolutely loved it.\u201d And then there were the games: the puzzles, quizzes and boardgames that, for a few days at this time of year, have an irresistible hold on many of us. Vorderman, perhaps more than any British public figure, has an instant association with mental agility. Between 1982 and 2008, she was the maths whiz on Channel 4\u2019s Countdown , so quick and flawless with the numbers that it seemed impossible there wasn\u2019t some television trickery going on. In January, she launched a podcast, Perfect 10 : a 10-minute, 10-question quiz that drops five times a week and is designed \u201cto educate, to entertain and to irritate the life out of you\u201d. The podcast has proved to be an addictive hit and led to a quiz book. In her spare time, Vorderman has also recently become an unlikely firebrand, named by Alastair Campbell as one of his two political heroes of 2023: \u201cProof that one person can make a difference and you\u2019re never too young or too old to do so.\u201d But more on that later. \u201cThere are lots of general knowledge quizzes out there,\u201d says Vorderman, when we meet in west London in early December. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t want that; with Perfect 10 , we were trying to test different parts of the brain, so everyone can have a go. That was the beauty of Countdown : you could either have five-letter words or seven-letter words, but you could score something . Against yourself, not necessarily against a champion. And on Perfect 10 it\u2019s quite easy to get five, but to get 10 is really bloody hard.\u201d Vorderman and fellow Countdown host Richard Whiteley. Photograph: Channel 4 Quizzes and games may be just for Christmas for some of us, but for Vorderman they are deeply ingrained. She traces the obsession right back to the beginning. She was born in Bedford, the youngest of three, but her Dutch father, Tony, walked out on the family when she was three weeks old. Vorderman\u2019s mother, Jean, moved back with her children to her home town of Prestatyn, in north Wales. \u201cWhen I was growing up we were dirt poor, we literally had nothing,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were in a little one-and-a-half bedroom flat, the downstairs flat. My brother Anton, who is seven years older then me, was really good at chess, so he taught me how to play. We used to go jumbling, as we called it, to jumble sales, with a shilling or sixpence. And those were the days really that were all games, games, games.\u201d Vorderman didn\u2019t see her father again until she was 42, but she does connect some of her aptitude in maths to him. \u201cI\u2019m pretty convinced that there\u2019s an element of DNA in it,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know about the Vordermans, but after I met him, so maybe 20 years ago, I discovered my great-grandfather was the Dutch scientist Adolphe Vorderman , who discovered the cure for beriberi, which led on to the discovery of vitamins. He\u2019s considered one of the great Dutch scientists in what we would have as Victorian times. And lots of doctors, pilots, all on that scientific side since then. So I think it must come from that.\u201d Anton and Vorderman\u2019s sister Trixie also seemed to inherit the maths genes and they would endlessly test one another on chess and logic games: because Carol was younger, she\u2019d usually lose, but she didn\u2019t mind. Out jumbling, they would buy thick books of sums and brain-teasers. \u201cWe used to love those,\u201d says Vorderman. \u201cWe used to buy 10 books for a penny, because they were just books that people had at home and chucked. Who wants a maths book, you know? Me!\u201d Aged 16, she was offered a place at Cambridge to study engineering: the first student on free school meals from a Welsh comprehensive, she thinks, to ever attend that university. Countdown came totally out of the blue. In the early 1980s, she left Wales for Leeds with her mother after Jean separated from Vorderman\u2019s stepfather. \u201cFor a year, we were basically living out the back of a car,\u201d she says. \u201cI said to her, \u2018This can\u2019t go on, Mum. I can\u2019t live like this and neither can you.\u2019 So we moved to Leeds and then three weeks later, she saw the advert for Countdown [in the Yorkshire Post ] and that\u2019s when things changed. But it never leaves you, being without a home. Certainly through the teenage years, my mum would leave my stepfather yet again, and we\u2019d end up, I don\u2019t know, in a bloody circus once! Here, there and everywhere. The memory of it doesn\u2019t leave you.\u201d Vorderman laughs when I say that some people are still convinced she did the Countdown sums with the help of advice through an earpiece. \u201cI could see the answer to the numbers,\u201d she says. \u201cI see it \u2013 in the way that some people can see the conundrum. So it\u2019s patterns for me, rather than calculation. If you said, \u2018Right, you\u2019ve got to go on telly live and do some Countdown games,\u2019 I would be half the speed that I used to be. But if I devoted a week just to Countdown games, I\u2019d get back to speed. I\u2019d have to get that muscle going again, those synapses going. But I\u2019d go, \u2018Yep, bring it on.\u2019 I\u2019d love a challenge like that.\u201d I genuinely have never felt freer or with more purpose in my life than I do now In 2014, Vorderman qualified for a private pilot\u2019s licence and it\u2019s clear that a big part of the appeal was testing her mental limits. \u201cFlying is great, because you\u2019re in real time and you have to concentrate or you die, basically,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is the potential of dying very quickly as a learner. A lot of people who learn to fly \u2013 private pilots not military pilots \u2013 are very busy people, and they find that this necessity to be in real time is very relaxing. There are squeaky-pants times, but I found learning to fly very relaxing. \u201cThere\u2019s a great phrase in flying, which is \u2018I\u2019m at capacity,\u2019\u201d she goes on. \u201cSo that\u2019s brain capacity. There\u2019s a sudden weather thing that comes in when you have only got 100ft before you land. You\u2019re at capacity. But there\u2019s something that I find really beautiful about that.\u201d Vorderman mainly just wants to keep stimulating herself in new and surprising ways. \u201cI sound odd, but I enjoy my brain,\u201d she says. \u201cSo it\u2019s like dressing up and all of this\u2026\u201d Vorderman, who wears a red OnePiece jumpsuit with black leather boots, gestures to the photoshoot that is being prepped around us and makes a snoring sound. \u201cI do it, it\u2019s part of the job. But this is me: happy in a onesie and no makeup. But the brain side of it, I really, really enjoy. That\u2019s part of the reason why I\u2019m enjoying the politics. Deep dives.\u201d Y es, politics: the second act of Vorderman\u2019s life that precisely no one saw coming, not even her. As Tim Burgess, the lead singer of the Charlatans, wrote on Twitter (now X) in January this year: \u201cCarol Vorderman helping bring down the government wasn\u2019t on my 2023 bingo card but I\u2019m very much here for it.\u201d Carol Vorderman helping bring down the government wasn\u2019t on my 2023 bingo card, but I\u2019m very much here for it \u2014 Tim Burgess (@Tim_Burgess) January 29, 2023 This new chapter began in November 2022 when Vorderman went on Twitter to criticise the Tory peer Michelle Mone, who had once been a close friend, over the PPE contracts scandal . We didn\u2019t know it then, but she was just warming up. Since then, she has put that black leather boot into the Conservative leadership with withering takedowns of Suella Braverman, Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak. The Guardian called her \u201ca more effective opposition than Labour\u201d and Vogue selected her as one of 25 women \u201cdefining and redefining Britain\u201d. Then, in November, her notoriety increased dramatically when she resigned from her weekly BBC Radio Wales show , because she would not comply with her employer\u2019s social media guidelines, which required staff \u201cto uphold the BBC\u2019s impartiality\u201d. When I ask Vorderman how she reflects on her surprising, combative 2023 \u2013 her comments have attracted almost as much opprobrium as praise \u2013 she explains that she gives everything in her life marks out of 10. \u201cSo for this year, I\u2019d give a 10, absolutely a 10,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m very lucky because I\u2019ve had a 40-year career. I\u2019m not a jobber. I don\u2019t have to pay the mortgage, I\u2019ve done very well. Kids are great. Health is great. And I genuinely have never felt freer or with more purpose in my life than I do now. That\u2019s why I say it\u2019s a 10 out of 10.\u201d Portrait by P\u00e5l Hansen. Vorderman\u2019s activism may have looked to many to have come from nowhere, but she traces it directly to her upbringing. \u201cTo witness what has happened, particularly in the last five years, is horrific,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd to not say something, I can\u2019t be that person. Now, obviously, it has led to changes in work patterns, let\u2019s say like the BBC, but that was my choice. I thought: \u2018No, you\u2019re trying to close me down, I\u2019ve tried to do what\u2026 Well, I\u2019ve half-tried to do what you\u2019ve said for about four weeks. No, you\u2019re trying to close me down.\u2019 So I knew what I wasn\u2019t allowed to say and I said it all: \u2018Here\u2019s a list of words you can\u2019t use\u2026\u2019\u201d Vorderman mimes tapping a keyboard. \u201cHere you go! Resignation by Twitter really. And sure enough, that\u2019s what happened.\u201d Vorderman is adamant that her political commentary is not tribal: over the years she has \u201cvoted for everybody, I\u2019m like a rainbow\u201d, and in 2009 she was responsible for a maths taskforce for David Cameron. It\u2019s what she sees as the corruption of the current government that irks her. \u201cThis is something else,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is really sinister and cruel. But I\u2019m a fighter. And never for me but I\u2019ll fight for someone else.\u201d Looking ahead to 2024, Vorderman is confident that she will not be short of work opportunities: there are advanced talks to turn the Perfect 10 format into a daily television series; maybe something else. But you can clearly see that\u2019s not where her focus lies. \u201cMy primary purpose is all about the election and dismantling them [the Conservatives],\u201d says Vorderman, with fire in her eyes. \u201cAnd if I lost every job and dismantle them, I\u2019d be more than happy.\u201d Vorderman\u2019s big push is to encourage people to vote tactically. \u201cI honestly believe \u2013 I know \u2013 that we can reduce them to 70 members of parliament or less at the next election,\u201d she says. \u201c74% of voters have said they will use tactical voting to actively reduce the number of Tory MPs. So polls are bad for them, but they\u2019re not as bad as it will be on the night. A bonfire of their vanities. Yes! I want it so that it would take at least a generation for them to regroup.\u201d She\u2019s done the sums and Vorderman\u2019s hoping that, as usual, she\u2019s right.

I used to come twice a year for work, back in the days when I was a fashion editor and I had a sort of secret boyfriend here (sssh), which made those visits all the more frisson-y. The queues for the Louvre are so long that even I, in my privileged position as a press-card holder, can\u2019t get close enough to wave my card at anyone. People smoke with a 1980s abandon, and the smoke, my daughter tells me, smells better than English smoke. There are chocolate shops aplenty. Paris\u2019s oldest is A La M\u00e8re de Famille . A must-visit. Full of character, it\u2019s the type of shop (I visited the original branch on the rue du Faubourg Montmartre) Ernst Lubitsch might base a film around, and it bustles with life and variety. It is almost overwhelming in its selection. Go on a quiet day, when you\u2019re not hungry or have young children in tow, and take your time, and a spare suitcase. Start with a box of selected chocolates, \u20ac17. Debauve & Gallais is a little younger. It was started by Louis XVI\u2019s chemist, Sulpice, who came up with a concoction of cocoa and sugar (the \u2018pistoles\u2019 are still on sale ) to help Marie Antoinette\u2019s headache medicine go down better, although I suspect the guillotine proved a more permanent cure. The experience here was a little more austere, but every single one of the chocolates sampled was superb. Follow Annalisa on X @AnnalisaB",

I\u2019ll tell you what it was. I\u2019ve started going to the library every day. Ah, the creamy pleasures of routine! Bran-based breakfast, a day in the stacks, dinner with heavy cutlery. All fine. Very \u201chip\u201d. Until the morning I realised I could drink tea all day, by taking a Thermos flask in with me. It was this little triumph \u2013 the I-could-sneak-tea-into-the-library moment \u2013 that made me realise a Rubicon had been crossed. I don\u2019t think I really knew how to use a toilet brush until about five years ago. It was always someone else\u2019s problem I\u2019m an acute case. But there\u2019s something about Christmas, a year\u2019s end, that makes many people feel the same. Something to do with that December tiredness, cold air chapping blue-veined skin. Perhaps you go home and meet friends from school, at the pub where you once needed fake ID. Their eyes have seen other things now, as have yours. Their skin hangs differently. Or it doesn\u2019t, in ways that whisper the lengths we go to deny time. I think about the people who didn\u2019t post their Spotify Wrapped, ashamed their favourite artist includes Bruce Springsteen for the 13th year running. Or the greater existential trapdoor \u2013 bands that occupy the mental category of new and cool, whether it\u2019s MGMT or CSS or Kurt Vile, only for some wretched little internet video to inform you that one song you liked turned 37 last year. I have friends who are terrified of turning 30, and I don\u2019t know what reaction they\u2019re hoping for. A Marx Brothers birthday cake to the face is the obvious one. But also: I understand. I\u2019ve been there; I will be there again. I can relate to their fear, even if the number is baby-small. It\u2019s easy to picture the hard bits of getting older. The seeping of beauty, strength, speed. A sense of humour that relies on advert catchphrases so covered by sand that we might as well be speaking Aramaic. It\u2019s the good, though, that is the mystery. Becoming oneself at last. Throwing out expectations that were never yours. Actually being able to do things. I don\u2019t think I really knew how to use a toilet brush until about five years ago. It was always someone else\u2019s problem. Now that home ownership, marriage and children arrive later for many, or not at all, there\u2019s a temptation to defer the maturity process off a cliff, like a student-loan debt. But there\u2019s a difference between running away from ageing and insisting we be allowed to do it our way. It\u2019s good to focus on the how, not the if of it all. Now I see mental slowness for what it also is \u2013 the sifting of experience, the expansion of my reflective capacity. No bad thing. My plan is to stick around, stay active and stay open. I think it\u2019s possible to do both of the latter, while also craving a flask of tea. It might involve updating my political beliefs, revisiting relationships, or learning compassion for my oldest friend, my body. The one who\u2019s been there for me in countless ways, a silent partner now getting to have its voice. Self-acceptance is probably our best shot at peace on earth. To be honest, my only surviving political belief is that Kofi Annan is secretary general of the UN, despite the fact he\u2019s been dead for five years. And there are other moments. Yesterday a woman stepped in front of traffic for me, stopping the cars with an outstretched arm. I presume lollipop ladies are there for people leaving school. In my experience they look after everyone, equal opportunities, like superheroes. Her gesture of protection pierced me. You assume, once you\u2019re a man, you\u2019re out there on your own. But we are all handed moments when one feels like a child again. Between tea and lollipops, our lives happen. The feeling of our bodies, the contexts we have moved through, is a shifting thing. We tell a linear story, because simplicity is a grace in storytelling. But in reality we are spirals, circling an essence, in constant motion. Never far from ourselves, yet never the same. We are all the ages we have been. And maybe even some we haven\u2019t. So Happy Birthday to me and Happy Christmas to you. I\u2019m gonna pop on my Heelys, and roll right down to the garden centre. Meet you there?",

        "description": "After a tired and desperate 2023 with our baby, finally my family found the deep bliss of sleepWhat brought us hope and joy in 2023? Writers share their storiesSleep, I came to understand this year, is everything. Without sleep, action, change and momentum all feel impossible. Without sleep, you are living half a life, an existence that is less about living and more about getting through. My husband and I entered 2023 in a state of complete exhaustion. Our baby had been hospitalised several times and through a combination of terror, survival and necessity, he and I had entered a co-sleeping arrangement that saw him waking every hour for milk.My husband was working full time and I was trying to juggle being essentially a stay-at-home mother with writing my column and promoting a book. The only reason I was still sane was because my husband consistently shared feeding and nights from the beginning, and at the worst times would often take the baby until the early hours so I could get a block of sleep from, say, 8pm until 2am. If I had a less supportive husband or a baby that didn\u2019t take a bottle from him, I suspect I would have lost my mind.We didn\u2019t sleep train \u2013 we hadn\u2019t needed to. We were those people whose baby slept through from eight weeks, blissful on his back in a starfish position \u2013 the ones who stay quiet when other parents despair of the frequent night wakings and strategise solutions with each other. We never talked about it unless we were directly asked, \u201cHow is he sleeping?\u201d Just wait for the four-month sleep regression, people said, darkly. But that never came. How smug we were, how self-satisfied at our infant\u2019s ability to self-settle, the fact that he instinctively seemed to know how to tank up before bed.What fools.It was illness that did for our baby\u2019s sleep. He came to rely on the comfort and reassurance of milk and touch, and we refused to deprive him of it, despite it being repeatedly suggested that we sleep train. I have never judged those who do; a mum who has let a baby cry it out is better than a dead mum (and I have friends who were so exhausted that they started to wish themselves away). But it wasn\u2019t for me. I knew I would crack. His sobs cut through me like a knife.Which is how I came to hear of Brenda Hart. \u201cYou should get Nanny Brenda,\u201d another mother said to me in the playground, her voice slightly lowered as if to acknowledge that her suggestion crossed a Rubicon. I live in Islington, surrounded by rich people who can afford to throw money at their problems, so this was not the first time I had heard the name of the elite sleep trainer. I\u2019d even read about her in the New Yorker, where Sam Knight described her as \u201ca matron of the old school\u201d. Her method is simple: you shut the door and let the baby cry it out.Despite my previous resolve not to do this, I started fantasising about hiring Brenda, not caring by this point how much it cost. I went back and forth endlessly in a way that she would probably roll her eyes at. I observed the sleep training wars of Mumsnet, internalising all the worst messages: leaving him to cry even for a minute would damage him irrevocably. A chastising paragraph from Philippa Perry\u2019s The Book You Wish Your Parents Had Read, which paid no heed at all to maternal mental health in its discussion of sleep training, haunted me. I believed on some level that sleep training would make me a bad mother. Yet I desperately needed rest. All I could think about and talk about was sleep.You\u2019re probably wondering, \u201cWhere\u2019s the hope?\u201d Did it lie with Nanny Brenda? Though Hart\u2019s success is undeniable, we didn\u2019t hire her in the end.Several things happened to change our lives. A perinatal psychologist recommended a book called Through the Night: Helping Parents and Sleepless Infants, by Dilys Daws, which is based on the idea that one should listen to the \u201ccries\u201d of the family as a whole. She says that when our baby cries, we hear ourselves crying as a baby, and our thoughts and feelings about how to respond are shaped by our own early experiences. That book, as well as my therapist, helped me understand that I feared separation would make my child anxious later in life, when in fact by failing to separate I could unwittingly be giving him the message that the world was unsafe without me there. Turning my fear on its head this way was truly transformative.Also, the baby started nursery, and was more tuckered out and had a more structured nap routine. But most importantly, I emailed Sam Knight at the New Yorker, who suggested that before hiring Brenda, we give his own, gentler method a try. \u201cKeep going!\u201d he signed off. \u201cThis too will pass.\u201d Hope!

The only reason I was still sane was because my husband consistently shared feeding and nights from the beginning, and at the worst times would often take the baby until the early hours so I could get a block of sleep from, say, 8pm until 2am. If I had a less supportive husband or a baby that didn\u2019t take a bottle from him, I suspect I would have lost my mind. We didn\u2019t sleep train \u2013 we hadn\u2019t needed to. We were those people whose baby slept through from eight weeks, blissful on his back in a starfish position \u2013 the ones who stay quiet when other parents despair of the frequent night wakings and strategise solutions with each other. We never talked about it unless we were directly asked, \u201cHow is he sleeping?\u201d Just wait for the four-month sleep regression, people said, darkly. But that never came. How smug we were, how self-satisfied at our infant\u2019s ability to self-settle, the fact that he instinctively seemed to know how to tank up before bed. What fools. It was illness that did for our baby\u2019s sleep. He came to rely on the comfort and reassurance of milk and touch, and we refused to deprive him of it, despite it being repeatedly suggested that we sleep train. I have never judged those who do; a mum who has let a baby cry it out is better than a dead mum (and I have friends who were so exhausted that they started to wish themselves away). But it wasn\u2019t for me. I knew I would crack. His sobs cut through me like a knife. Which is how I came to hear of Brenda Hart. \u201cYou should get Nanny Brenda,\u201d another mother said to me in the playground, her voice slightly lowered as if to acknowledge that her suggestion crossed a Rubicon. I live in Islington, surrounded by rich people who can afford to throw money at their problems, so this was not the first time I had heard the name of the elite sleep trainer. I\u2019d even read about her in the New Yorker , where Sam Knight described her as \u201ca matron of the old school\u201d. Her method is simple: you shut the door and let the baby cry it out. Despite my previous resolve not to do this, I started fantasising about hiring Brenda, not caring by this point how much it cost. I went back and forth endlessly in a way that she would probably roll her eyes at. I observed the sleep training wars of Mumsnet, internalising all the worst messages: leaving him to cry even for a minute would damage him irrevocably. A chastising paragraph from Philippa Perry\u2019s The Book You Wish Your Parents Had Read , which paid no heed at all to maternal mental health in its discussion of sleep training, haunted me. I believed on some level that sleep training would make me a bad mother. Yet I desperately needed rest. All I could think about and talk about was sleep. You\u2019re probably wondering, \u201cWhere\u2019s the hope?\u201d Did it lie with Nanny Brenda? Though Hart\u2019s success is undeniable, we didn\u2019t hire her in the end. Several things happened to change our lives. A perinatal psychologist recommended a book called Through the Night: Helping Parents and Sleepless Infants, by Dilys Daws , which is based on the idea that one should listen to the \u201ccries\u201d of the family as a whole. She says that when our baby cries, we hear ourselves crying as a baby, and our thoughts and feelings about how to respond are shaped by our own early experiences. That book, as well as my therapist, helped me understand that I feared separation would make my child anxious later in life, when in fact by failing to separate I could unwittingly be giving him the message that the world was unsafe without me there. Turning my fear on its head this way was truly transformative. Also, the baby started nursery, and was more tuckered out and had a more structured nap routine. But most importantly, I emailed Sam Knight at the New Yorker, who suggested that before hiring Brenda, we give his own, gentler method a try. \u201cKeep going!\u201d he signed off. \u201cThis too will pass.\u201d Hope! My advice about the stress zone that is toddler mealtimes: do your best and get by \u2013 everything else is just noise | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett Read more I read Sam\u2019s emails to my husband and we devised a plan for him to night wean the baby (it has to be the man that does it, because the baby can smell its mother\u2019s milk). My husband took a week off work, and each night he picked the baby up every time he cried, cuddled him until he was calm, and put him down. The first night he must have done this 30 times. The second, 10. The third, three. On the fourth night, my son slept through. Life was transformed, and largely thanks to two dads: Sam Knight and my lovely husband, who pushed himself to the limit for our family. (Perhaps they should go into business, charging \u00a3500 a pop). I am beyond thankful to them both. I\u2019m not saying that sleep is ever perfect, but I\u2019m writing this to pass on the hope. To those parents who are reading this in a similarly dark place, keep going: sleep can be yours again. Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist",

        "content": "1. Billy Woods and Kenny Segal: Maps Backwoodz Studioz; May Leftfield New York rapper Billy Woods released a pair of superb collaborative albums this year: Maps , with producer Kenny Segal , and We Buy Diabetic Test Strips , as half of Armand Hammer . Of two very different records, both anchored by this caustic sophisticate\u2019s free associating, Maps edges it for its sly, deadpan take on a dissociative life in motion. 2. CMAT: Crazymad, for Me AWAL; October CMAT, AKA Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson. Photograph: Sarah Doyle A bittersweet concept album about a misspent relationship in Irish singer-songwriter Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson\u2019s youth, Crazymad, for Me was like a night of espresso martinis with your most voluble friend, channelling the self-actualising energy of Self Esteem with added country brio and a dash of Fleetwood Mac . 3. 100 Gecs : 10,000 G ecs Dogshow/Atlantic; March Now based in LA, hyper-pop-punk aesthetes Dylan Brady and Laura Les once again transformed seemingly obnoxious base metals into surreal and surprisingly emotional gold. Defiantly stupid, and spectacularly sharp at the same time, 100 Gecs pondered corn snacks, worried about bills and dumped losers while setting off musical fireworks indoors . 4. Billy Nomates: Cacti Invada; January Appallingly better known for taking abusive Glastonbury commentators to task than for her arresting songs, Billy Nomates is \u2013 or possibly, was \u2013 the pseudonym of indie auteur Tor Maries (she may have retired it). But if you were a person who needed to hear her acerbic, 80s-leaning earworms about self-care and vertigo , they hit home like a spiked mallet. 5. Janelle Mon\u00e1e: The Age of Pleasure Wondaland/Atlantic; June Pleasure principle\u2026 Janelle Mon\u00e1e, pictured on stage in New Orleans in June. Getty Images What now seems like aeons ago, the multi-hyphenate artist Janelle Mon\u00e1e once rapped in riddles and resisted the male gaze. The Age of Pleasure , her fourth album, prioritised pleasure, the logical conclusion of a series of increasingly sex-positive releases that could only end in this joyously sapphic pool party . 6. Mitski: The Land Is Inhospitable and So Are We Dead Oceans; September Having threatened retirement, Mitski returned with another lacerating album whose existential concerns were sublimated into different strains of Americana : plangent pedal steel, churning indie rock, orchestral oompah jazz. Her songs of snow, frost and stars only cemented her status as an all-American talent for the ages. 7. Jpegmafia x Danny Brown: Scaring the Hoes Peggy; March Another rapper who dropped two essential albums in 2023, maverick Danny Brown here combined with fellow margin-walker Jpegmafia to challenge 100 Gecs for the tinnitus crown. This avant-rap double-header allied attention-deficit soundscapes to Danny and Peggy\u2019s furious, funny observations. Ironically, perhaps, the results were catchy as hell . 8. The Tubs: Dead Meat Trouble in Mind; January Indie rock periodically receives a stylistic shot in the arm (see Mitski, circa 2018). This year\u2019s B12 jab came from former members of London-based Welsh band Joanna Gruesome in their sublime new incarnation, the Tubs. Not only did singing guitarist Owen Williams sound like Richard Thompson fronting Sugar , the Tubs\u2019 riveting songs dealt trenchantly with manic episodes and bad rashes. 9. Jaimie Branch: Fly Or Die Fly Or Die Fly Or Die ((world war)) International Anthem; August A posthumous release from a prodigious trumpeter, Fly Or Die \u2026 ((world war)) was the third in a series of Branch records that expanded what contemporary jazz could be: politically progressive, mellifluously Latinate. Part protest record, part polyrhythmic workout , Fly Or Die also made room for an Americana-hued Meat Puppets cover. 10. Lana Del Rey: Did You Know That There\u2019s a Tunnel Under Ocean B l v d Polydor; March Lana Del Rey. Photograph: Neil Krug Gospel singers, ministering pastors and startling musical about-faces dot this ambitious record, one of the most compelling in a strong canon. There are, as expected, glossy Del Rey surfaces, but there are also songs of death and loss.",

        "content": "Caf\u00e9 Kitty, Underbelly Boulevard, 6 Walker\u2019s Court, London W1F 0BT (020 3772 3922; cafekitty.co.uk ).

I prefer the sound of the menu in front of me, with its hot promise of devilled eggs and buffalo chicken with stilton dressing. That\u2019s the kind of spanking I really fancy. It\u2019s common to mourn the passing of the old Soho and its cast of consciously raffish characters with their dilated pupils and gin-ravaged breath. The protection rackets have gone and almost all the little red lamps in the upper floor windows, those tiny lighthouses each warning of a life dashed on the rocks of poisonous lust and exploitation, have been switched off. Mourning that is ill-considered nostalgia. The old Soho may have had \u201ccharacters\u201d, but most could be bloody annoying gone 10pm, and if there\u2019s less of the drugs and fewer young people being forced into prostitution, then all to the good. In the digital age, when stimulation can be sourced easily from the blue-grey glow of a computer screen, the survival of the Mood Sex Shop is almost sweet. It\u2019s like finding a gnarly prehistoric species of fish ill-suited to the modern world, which somehow swims on. \u2018On a par with the superb version served by Hawksmoor\u2019: Caesar salad. Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer Of course, bits of Soho have been redeveloped. Everywhere has, including me; my prosthetic hip is a necessary bit of structural underpinning. In these narrow streets there are outcrops of new-build and shiny bits of glass. But the area is still full of bars, clubs and restaurants that are worth visiting. They are rooms you want to be in, offering cocktails you\u2019ve never heard of before and innovative ways with miso or hispi you\u2019ve never eaten. The fact is, Soho has never quite been what it once was. It has always moved on. A perfect example is to be found at the Boulevard Theatre. The modern redevelopment of this alleyway, which has been here since the early 18th century, occupies the site of what once was a sister venue to the Raymond Revuebar. Now it\u2019s one of the most innovative and intimate of performance spaces in London, which can rotate and be reconfigured in a whole bunch of ways. It originally opened in 2019, with exciting plans, but the pandemic did for that. Finally, in October, it was taken over by Underbelly, producers of comedy on the South Bank and the production of Cabaret at the Playhouse, which has converted the whole theatre into the Kit Kat Club. They like offering a total, rounded experience, do Underbelly. \u2018The toast element is a little flimsy and thin\u2019: \u2018Very Welsh\u2019 rarebit. Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer Hence Caf\u00e9 Kitty, in the low-ceilinged first-floor restaurant space. The banquettes are a deep ultramarine. The walls are a dirty salmon pink, inlaid with long ovals, some of them mirrored, as if it\u2019s a modern take on the Parisian art nouveau brasserie, complete with globe lights. There is even a slightly knackered piano in the corner. I am temperamentally predisposed to like a restaurant with a piano, however battered it may be. The restaurant comes from the team behind the much-adored Kitty Fisher\u2019s in Mayfair and Cora Pearl in Covent Garden. This means the menu includes the Kitty Fisher\u2019s \u201ccrispy potatoes\u201d, which are another take on those finely sliced, confited, compacted then deep-fried spuds that have become all the rage, for the simple reason that they are sharp-edged blocks of striated, deep-fried, golden carb loveliness. You have desires, do you? Well get out of Walker\u2019s Court and get your arse up here to satisfy them. They have crispy potatoes. Unlike the original Kitty Fisher\u2019s, where the menu gives an impression of starters and mains, here it really is a set of small plates, mostly priced in the low teens, plus one of those salt-aged steaks from Hannan Meats . Some people find these parades of small things unsatisfying, disjointed and a little random, because it\u2019s too much like the rest of life. I get the point. We crave structure and familiarity. Then again, these are very good small things, so we should accept the randomness. The devilled eggs, from the snack list, are not some fancy take on the 70s stager. They just are the 70s stager, the yolk whipped up with mayo and cayenne and reintroduced to its resting place. They also serve a real Caesar salad, unblemished by deathly cotton-wool chicken breast or spongy industrial prawns. It is romaine, salted anchovies (not the horror of boquerones), croutons and the right dressing. It\u2019s on a par with the superb version served by Hawksmoor . \u2018Made by someone who has bothered to read the recipe\u2019: buffalo chicken. Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer Crispy potatoes, devilled eggs and a proper Caesar salad. That sounds like dinner to me, but other things are worth your time. There\u2019s a picture-pretty tarte Tatin made with roasted, chewy squash and crisp, caramelised onions on buttery pastry. There are dense slices of trout gravadlax, the colour of a Christmas satsuma, with a mustardy coleslaw. There are those hunks of crisp battered chicken thigh, with a hot-sour buffalo chicken wing sauce made by someone who has read the recipe. There is also what they call the \u201cVery Welsh\u201d rarebit, because it\u2019s a little spicier than most. I\u2019ll be honest, I wouldn\u2019t risk an incendiary title like that. I assume it\u2019s meant to be the edible equivalent of Michael Sheen , with exploding lockdown salt-and-pepper hair and beard, shouting a battle cry at you from the western side of Offa\u2019s Dyke. It kind of is, though the toast element is a little flimsy and thin. If you\u2019re going to call something \u201cVery Welsh\u201d, nothing should ever be flimsy and thin. But that\u2019s me picking at nits. The main feeling is of a new space in Soho, which manages to feel both tucked away and right in the heart of things at the same time. Come here just for a Bad Kitty cocktail. That\u2019s gin, sloe gin, elderflower, lemon and cava. Or perhaps start with one of those and finish with a boozy knickerbocker glory, plump with liquored up cherries. Maybe have their pear and gingerbread mousse under drifts of biscuit crumb. Or simply make a night of it and stay on to take in a show. You\u2019re in Soho. The lights are twinkling. It\u2019s what the area\u2019s for. Next week I\u2019ll be looking back at 2023. In the meantime, have a great Christmas. News bites I\u2019m dedicating these last news bites of 2023 to a few things close to my heart, starting with a brilliant charity called the Food Chain, of which I am a patron. It began in 1988 as a one-off lunch on Christmas Day for people with Aids/HIV. Tomorrow, therefore, marks the 35th birthday of a charity that provides vital nutritional advice and support to those vulnerable people with HIV who, despite huge advances in pharmaceuticals, need help. Many referrals to the Food Chain come from the NHS and yet the charity receives no state funding. They are always grateful for donations. Here\u2019s a link to their fundraising page. Also doing brilliant things is Well Grounded, a not-for-profit social enterprise that gets people facing blocks to employment into work, through professional barista training and general experience of the coffee industry. I\u2019ve been lucky enough this year to see what they do closeup and they are one of the most inclusive and supportive organisations I\u2019ve ever come across, with a profound commitment to diversity. They could always use extra funds for their services, which are provided free to users. Their crowdfunding page is here . And, finally, the actor, painter and cheese-maker Sean Wilson has just published a book called Jazz Food . Given my twin roles as restaurant critic and jazz pianist, how could I not mention that? It\u2019s a beautiful volume bringing together essays on jazz, Sean\u2019s vivid portraits of greats like Nina Simone, Charlie Mingus and George Melly and suggested playlists, with recipes for the likes of crab and chicken gumbo, Kansas-style ribs and Caribbean rice pudding. It\u2019s available to buy direct from Rachel Cooke Publishing . Email Jay at jay.rayner@observer.co.uk or follow him on X @jayrayner1",

        "content": "POLITICS David Cameron Somewhat oddly for a leader who had spent much of the latter part of 2023 trying to brand himself as the \u201cchange\u201d prime minister, Rishi Sunak delved into the back catalogue of recent Tory PMs to freshen up his cabinet in November. His big \u201creveal\u201d was the return of David Cameron , the one-time Tory golden boy, who had quit in humiliation after calling and then losing the Brexit referendum in June 2016. Cameron had once taunted Tony Blair late on in the Labour leader\u2019s time at No 10 with the killer line \u201c you were the future once \u201d, only to see his own premiership bedevilled by European divisions before being prematurely destroyed by the people\u2019s verdict on EU membership. It is said that another ex-Tory leader, William Hague, helped Sunak persuade Cameron that a job in government as foreign secretary with a seat in the House of Lords was just what he and the ailing Conservative government needed. David Cameron. Photograph: Kin Cheung/AP Hague\u2019s argument to his old friend was that a return might allow him to end his political career on a higher note, rather than always being remembered as the leader who left after a massive self-inflicted humiliation. Cameron is said to have become bored away from politics, working in his garden hut, and irritated that his legacy was so tainted. So Hague was pushing at a door that was already ajar. Cameron\u2019s return was controversial not only because of his involvement in the Lex Greensill lobbying scandal , but also his close links with China. But despite both, the broadly positive media response took the spotlight away from Sunak\u2019s many domestic travails, for a few days at least. Somewhat self-mockingly Cameron hit upon the title of Lord Cameron of Chipping Norton , after the posh social set of which he remains a central figure. But Ukraine, the Middle East, even Brussels beckon now, at least until the next general election, rather than parties with Rebekah Brooks, CEO of Sun and Times publisher News UK. Nigel Farage. Photograph: James Gourley/ITV Also back: Nigel Farage Arguably the most influential UK politician of recent decades, Farage was back on our television screens, if not in politics. Not yet, fully, anyway. The former Ukip and Brexit party leader used his \u00a31.5m appearance fee from ITV\u2019s I\u2019m a Celebrity \u2026 Get me Out of Here! to do more than merely make money. It was also clearly part of a mission to raise his profile again , before a general election, and at a time when many Tories are desperately looking out for a saviour. In interviews after returning from the Australian jungle, Farage dismissed the notion of rejoining the Tories while Sunak was leader, but didn\u2019t rule out doing so one day: \u201cNever say never. I can\u2019t predict right now what will happen.\u201d TELEVISION Happy Valley Sarah Lancashire in Happy Valley. Photograph: Matt Squire/BBC BBC One\u2019s Bafta-garlanded Happy Valley was the most anticipated television comeback of 2023, returning for its third and final series seven years after the second, and series creator Sally Wainwright ensured Sergeant Catherine Cawood , as played by Sarah Lancashire, reappeared in all her redoubtable West Yorkshire glory. In the opening moments, Cawood stomped across a drained mud-clagged reservoir, identified a putrefied corpse by its dentistry, humiliated smug male colleagues, then made her exit with a muttered derisive \u201cTwats!\u201d The Calder Valley phenomenon was back, though in terms of British cultural consciousness, it\u2019s unclear whether Cawood or Happy Valley ever really went away. The series may be British but it has long enjoyed international appeal \u2013 celebrity fans include Bob Dylan, Jamie Lee Curtis and comedian Amy Schumer\u2013 and global kudos \u2013 Lancashire recently won performance of the year at the Rose d\u2019Or awards . Its secret? A taut mesh of violent criminality, staunch integrity, flawless ensemble playing, and dust-dry northern humour. The dark jewel in the crown was the near-biblical conflict between Cawood and Tommy Lee Royce, played by James Norton , whom Cawood held responsible for her daughter\u2019s death, and who was seeking to influence her grandson. This was the battle \u2013 irredeemable psychopath versus incorruptible matriarch \u2013 that elevated the Happy Valley comeback to sure-fire event TV, drawing an audience of millions for the Cawood-Royce final reckoning. Nine years after it first appeared, the series left an imperishable legacy front-loaded by a no-nonsense game-changer of a female character. What will British television do without her? Barbara Ellen David Tennant as Doctor Who. Photograph: Sally Mais/BBC Also back: David Tennant as Doctor Who In a move that will have Whovians discussing the impact on the canon for generations and regenerations to come, this year Tennant became the 10th and the 14th Doctor. Purists may be miffed, but his return \u2013 in episode The Star Beast \u2013 pulled in more than 9 million viewers. Jodie Whittaker\u2019s final episode in the show was watched by 6.3 million. CINEMA Hayao Miyazaki of Studio Ghibli Hayao Miyazaki. Photograph: The Asahi Shimbun/Getty Ten years ago, around the 2013 release of his film The Wind Rises , the animation legend Hayao Miyazaki announced his retirement. His statement prompted much fretful speculation among animation fans about who, if anyone, could shoulder the Studio Ghibli mantle and follow the man who created My Neighbour Totoro , Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke ? Miyazaki\u2019s son, Gor\u014d Miyazaki, was briefly touted, then rather ruled himself out of contention with the disappointing 2020 release Earwig and the Witch . But by this point, rumours had already started to circulate that Miyazaki senior\u2019s retirement might not be quite as final as feared. It was confirmed in 2017 that Miyazaki was indeed working on another feature film which was at that point titled How Do You Live? Details around the project were tantalisingly scarce, and so closely did Studio Ghibli guard the film that no trailer was released until a few days before the world premiere in Japan, and no advance press screenings held. Fans pored over a few enigmatic stills and the scantest plot description. All of which had the desired effect of building anticipation around the picture, retitled The Boy and the Heron , to fever pitch. The visually dazzling fantasy adventure, with a story that straddles 1940s Japan and a magical parallel dimension, was the hottest ticket at the Toronto film festival in October, with punters queuing for hours in the hope of being among the first outside of Japan to watch it. UK audiences will finally get to see the film on Boxing Day and should prepare for mystical realms, murderous parakeets and a return to the densely detailed mythic storytelling of classic Miyazaki. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet in Wonka. Photograph: Jaap Buittendijk/Warner Bros Also back: Willy Wonka The conjuror-chocolatier in the frock coat and top hat makes a welcome return to the big screen : Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet breathes fresh life into the character of Roald Dahl\u2019s Willy Wonka in Paul King\u2019s exuberant prequel. The film follows a young Willy, an eccentric dreamer with a suitcase full of chocolate-making equipment, as he attempts to launch himself in a world of bespoke confectionery dominated by the nefarious chocolate cartel.Chalamet\u2019s Wonka is a sweeter, less-jaded take on the character first played by Gene Wilder in 1971 , and \u2013 fortunately \u2013 he\u2019s nowhere near as skin-crawlingly creepy as the 2005 Johnny Depp version . EUROPE Donald Tusk, prime minister of Poland Donald Tusk. Photograph: Damian Burzykowski/Newspix There were more than a few groans when Donald Tusk returned to Poland after finishing his stint as European Council president and announced his intention to return to front-line domestic politics. But there was also some excitement \u2013 many people disliked Tusk, but as the rightwing, nationalist Law and Justice party continued dismantling democratic institutions, there were also some who said he was the only name big enough to take them on. The latter group turned out to be right. Tusk fought a hard, passionate electoral campaign for the October vote that remained too close to call in opinion polls right up to polling day, but his Civic Coalition gained enough votes to be able to unite with two other opposition parties and form a government . In the end, it wasn\u2019t even that close, a result in large part attributed to Tusk\u2019s energetic campaigning and willingness to get out to smaller towns and the countryside, shedding some of his and his party\u2019s reputation as being all about the metropolitan elites. Sandwiched between disappointing election results for progressives in Slovakia and the Netherlands , Tusk\u2019s win is a welcome reminder that Europe\u2019s political direction is not all one-way, and that populist, nationalist parties can be defeated at the ballot box. His coalition will be broad and possibly unwieldy, and he is certainly not the fresh political face that many younger Poles crave to see running the country, but after eight years of Law and Justice, a Tusk government is likely to feel like a breath of fresh air. LIFESTYLE The colour pink Margot Robbie in Barbie. Photograph: Landmark Media/Alamy It was Pierpaolo Piccioli, creative director of fashion house Valentino, who brought pink back. His autumn-winter 2022-23 collection was limited to two colours: black and a specific hot pink which has now been added to Pantone\u2019s official colour scale with the name Pink PP. At his show, Piccioli said \u201c[Pink\u2019s] a colour you can subvert, because it already has a lot of meaning. It was the colour of the power of men, then it became girlish \u2026 Today, it means different things.\u201d In 2023, this bubblegum shade meant red carpet glamour as celebrities from Viola Davis at the Met Gala and Stephanie Hsu at the Oscars to Jill Biden during her UK visit for King Charles\u2019s coronation chose outfits in a colour that, until this year, was mainly found in the toddler aisle of Toys R Us. With the behemoth of Barbiecore , hot pink became part of the conversation around Greta Gerwig\u2019s Barbie . Like the highest grossing film of the year, pink is polarising. Is it liberating to reclaim it? Or just another consumerist attempt to sell misogyny disguised as feminism to a new audience? Against a social media backdrop where the world \u201cgirl\u201d is used instead of \u201cwoman\u201d \u2013 think the hashtags \u201cgirl dinner\u201d and \u201cgirl maths\u201d on TikTok \u2013 the jury is still out. Either way, in 2023 pink wasn\u2019t so much about making the boys wink. It certainly made us think. Pamela Anderson. Photograph: Fred Duval/SOPA Images Also back: Pamela Anderson This year the Baywatch actor has enjoyed if not a revival then a retort to the way she was objectified during her 1990s heyday. January brought Pamela , A Love Story , an Emmy-nominated documentary which, Anderson said, let her \u201ctake control of the narrative for the first time\u201d. This autumn she\u2019s taken to turning up makeup-free to fashion events and she\u2019s also announced that she\u2019s selling all of her 90s wardrobe as she wants to \u201cclear my mind, clear my closet, make room for new life\u201d. SPORT Simone Biles Simone Biles. Photograph: DeFodi Images/Getty As the Tokyo Olympics faded into the background, for so long it was unclear if Simone Biles would ever be seen in competition again. Despite being heavily favoured to dominate, Tokyo turned into her nightmare. Biles was forced to withdraw from five of her six finals due to the twisties , a mental block that makes competing dangerous. While the gymnastics community was sympathetic, many pundits branded Biles a \u201cquitter\u201d. Along with the general pressure from and the anxiety she felt while competing in empty stadiums without her family, Biles was still processing the trauma of being a sexual abuse survivor of Larry Nassar , the former team doctor of USA Gymnastics, and the only survivor still competing by 2021. After the Olympics, Biles stepped away from the sport. Earlier this year, when her life seemed to be consumed by planning for her marriage to her partner, Jonathan, in April, there was little indication that Biles had made a decision on her career . At 26 years old, a true veteran in gymnastics, fans and experts began to wonder if she had decided to move on. She had not. Biles had been secretly training for months and in June her name unexpectedly appeared on a list of participants at a USA Gymnastics training camp that week. Within days, her dominance seamlessly resumed. Biles won the competition, then obliterated her domestic rivals all summer. At the world championships, Biles won gold medals in the all-around, team, balance beam and floor exercise competitions and a silver on the vault. She now holds the all-time gymnastics record for medals at the Olympics and world championships. Alongside her medal haul, Biles finally clinched her fifth, and most daring, eponymous skill. On the vault, she landed the Yurchenko double pike vault at an international competition for the first time in her career. With every new achievement, Biles insisted she was back simply to ensure that she could finally find enjoyment in the sport she loves and to win for herself. Nobody else. Elina Svitolina. Photograph: Al Bello/Getty Also back: Elina Svitolina Ukraine\u2019s most successful tennis player stepped away from her sport in March 2022, citing burnout. Svitolina and Ga\u00ebl Monfils, her husband and fellow top tennis player, eventually announced that she would take an even longer hiatus as she was expecting their first child. In Svitolina\u2019s time away from competition, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine continued to decimate parts of her country. Svitolina\u2019s return has been remarkable. Just a handful of events into her comeback, ranked No 508, the former No 3 won a WTA title in Strasbourg, which she immediately followed with a rousing run to the quarter-finals of the French Open . Weeks later Svitolina toppled the No 1, Iga Swiatek, on Centre Court en route to the semi-finals of Wimbledon . Now 29, Svitolina sees her goals as providing relief and inspiration to her country as it defends itself, and for her daughter, Skai. Sha\u2019Carri Richardson. Photograph: Petr David Josek/AP Sha\u2019Carri Richardson The US track star was one of the fastest women in the world after an incredible breakout season in 2021. Just as a showdown with the best seemed likely, though, disaster struck. Richardson tested positive for marijuana on the eve of the Olympic trials, ruling her out of the event and therefore Paris. Richardson, 23, would become the butt of many internet jokes due to her over-exuberant attitude and her subsequent struggles in 2022. But this year, in her first world championships, she clinched gold in the 100m , to which she added gold in the 4x200m relay and then bronze in the 200m. Her year was ultimately defined by the mantra that she repeated when winning the US championships 100m title in July : \u201cI\u2019m not back, I\u2019m better.\u201d TRAVEL Sleeper trains in Europe Orient Express lounge. Photograph: Accor Night trains are reappearing across Europe as passengers opt for journeys that are greener than short-haul flights and also offer the old-school charm of traditional travel. While the UK has two sleeper trains \u2013 London to Scotland and London to Cornwall \u2013 many of the trans-European routes had stopped running over the last decade. But, in 2023, a range of night trains launched for the first time in years, including the Good Night train linking Brussels and Berlin via Amsterdam, and Nightjet\u2019s new route from Munich and Vienna to Genoa, travelling via the beautiful coastal route of the Italian Cinque Terre area. Swedish company SJ also extended its Stockholm to Hamburg route to Berlin in April. This comeback is only just getting started: in 2024, the Orient Express La Dolce Vita will launch, connecting Venice, Rome, Siena and the Italian Riviera. The French company Midnight Trains is also set to launch luxury trains linking Paris to 10 destinations including Edinburgh, Rome and Porto. WILDLIFE The York groundsel York groundsel. Photograph: Andrew Shaw/Rare British Plants Nursery One in six species of animals and plants may be at risk of extinction in Britain but one humble yellow flower came back from the dead this year. York groundsel was an urban flower that thrived on railway sidings and derelict land in the city of its name. It evolved into a new species over the past century after Oxford ragwort, a non-native flower, hybridised with native groundsel. It was discovered and given its scientific name, Senecio eboracensis , in 1979 \u2013 the first new species to have evolved in Britain for 50 years. The plant\u2019s success was short-lived though: the over-zealous application of weed killer saw it disappear as wild urban spaces were \u201ctidied up\u201d and built on. It was last seen in the wild in 1991. Luckily, plant scientists kept three small specimens in pots on a windowsill in the University of York. When these died, a pinch of seed was harvested and lodged at Kew\u2019s Millennium Seed Bank. Tests found that very few of the tiny seeds germinated. Experts feared that the seed was reaching the end of its lifespan so botanists for Natural England, the government\u2019s environmental watchdog, thought they would attempt to resurrect the species. One hundred seeds were planted in a polytunnel at the Rare British Plants Nursery in Wales. To the botanists\u2019 surprise, 98 seeds geminated successfully. More plants were propagated and fresh seed harvested. In February this year, six grams of seed \u2013 potentially thousands of plants \u2013 were sown into special plots on council and Network Rail land in York. In May, the first plants in the wild for 32 years began to flower, bringing colour to the streets and railway sidings. Conservationists warn that it is much more difficult and expensive to reintroduce species once they are gone \u2013 better to save them from going extinct in the first place. And this kind of \u201cde-extinction\u201d is unlikely to be replicated in Britain because York groundsel was the only globally extinct British plant that persisted in seed form. Nevertheless, the success \u2013 and other revivals of extinct animals from white-tailed eagles to large blue butterflies \u2013 shows that lost species can be revived, even in one of the most nature-depleted nations on Earth. TECH Bitcoin Bitcoin. Photograph: Beno\u00eet Tessier/Reuters Investors in the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency know a thing or two about changing fortunes. Last year\u2019s high-profile bitcoin scandals, including the bankruptcy and felony charges brought against major crypto exchange FTX , saw the currency lose more than 60% of its value. Meanwhile, the slow implosion of NFTs only made onlookers even more wary of blockchain technology. By the end of the year, the mild interest that many conventional investors had shown across bitcoin\u2019s lifespan appeared to have finally calcified into a healthy scepticism. But if 2022 will be remembered as the year bitcoin lost its gloss, 2023 stands a chance of going down as the year it proved its resilience. The price of the cryptocurrency has more than doubled in the last 12 months, hitting a 20-month high in December. And that\u2019s despite ongoing troubles: FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty of defrauding the platform\u2019s customers in November, while crypto exchange Binance was fined $4.3bn after it pleaded guilty to money laundering. Advocates are framing the crackdown as a watershed for the industry, hoping it marks the departure of its more unscrupulous actors. Elsewhere, bitcoin looks positioned to eke more credibility from financial markets. Investment companies such as BlackRock have filed to launch spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds \u2013 investment vehicles that hold bitcoins directly. It\u2019s thought it will offer a regulated way of investing in the currency, and spare investors the fiddly business of managing the digital wallets and keys. Plenty still scoff at bitcoin\u2019s future, but it\u2019s presently enjoying quite the turnaround. MUSIC The Beatles The Beatles. Photograph: Alamy Now and Then was an apt title for the new(ish) Beatles song that brought the band back to the top of the UK charts 40-odd years after the murder of John Lennon. Technically part of pop\u2019s past, the all-conquering Liverpool outfit remain an enduring reference point. The hit Get Back 2021 documentary series by Peter Jackson reframed the Beatles for fans old and new, preparing the ground for this latest resurgence. Now and Then came thanks to advances in audio technology. The song formed part of a batch of Lennon sketches the surviving Beatles punched up into song form in the 90s. Then, it was impossible to extract a usable vocal from the 1979 Lennon piano demo; the track was shelved. But modern machine-assisted learning demixing software removed ambient noise from the tape. Despite some consternation from fans about AI, Now and Then was no deepfake. It sounded eminently plausible. The late George Harrison\u2019s guitar parts survived from the 90s. Ringo Starr re-did his drums; in tribute to Harrison, Paul McCartney wrote a new guitar solo that sounded so Harrison-esque even Starr was fooled. Unity was a theme: producer Giles Martin \u2013 son of \u201cfifth Beatle\u201d George Martin \u2013 added in Fab backing vocals culled from other masters. Traditionalists might have balked, but modern pop is routinely spliced together this way, and the Beatles were always a very modern band. The result was a small, sentimental pleasure in a year full of conflicts whose regressiveness would have appalled the author of Give Peace a Chance. Kylie Minogue. Photograph: Matt Crossick/PA Also back: Kylie Minogue The Australian singer has never really gone away in the UK. Her 2020 album Disco provided pure pandemic escapism. But this year she scored a world-slaying viral social media hit in the form of Padam Padam (in case you missed it: the sound of a beating heart). It was ubiquitous at Pride and, coming two decades after Can\u2019t Get You Out of My Head , Padam suggested that a new generation of younger fans might not care how old female entertainers are any more. Could the glass mirrorball be shattering? Andr\u00e9 3000. Photograph: PA Images/Alamy Andr\u00e9 3000 The title of the first song on the Atlanta rapper\u2019s surprise new release said it all: I Swear, I Really Wanted To Make A \u2018Rap\u2019 Album But This Is Literally The Way The Wind Blew Me This Time . Seventeen years on from OutKast\u2019s last album, this huge star doubled down on his new obsession: the flute, in all its forms. Made with a collective of Los Angeles jazz musicians helmed by Carlos Ni\u00f1o, the meditative New Blue Sun invited listeners to shelve preconceptions and embrace reinvention.",

I like mowing the lawn, doing \u2018dad\u2019 things I never thought I\u2019d derive the vaguest enjoyment from. We live near the Grand Union canal, the River Brent and the Thames. I\u2019m smitten with boat yards, so I like to go for long walks up the river or the canal. Sunday roast? We try to eat together on Sunday evenings, but it won\u2019t necessarily be a roast. I might do a bolognese or a carbonara and I like to buy the proper meat from the Italian deli. I spend an awful lot of time cooking simple dishes. I\u2019m not sure why it takes me so long. Sundays growing up? Fighting with my sister is my main memory. We\u2019d go to church and Mum would do a roast. Whatever the meat, we\u2019d have Yorkshire pudding with gravy, as the starter. Dad was the Midlands correspondent for the Daily Telegraph , so there was no guarantee he\u2019d be around, except on Sundays, when we\u2019d go to the tip, which, for some reason, growing up in Kidderminster, felt like a treat. Sunday night blues? The opening bars of Songs of Praise or Last of the Summer Wine still make my tummy turn over with the memory that I\u2019ve got to go to school tomorrow. Which is a bit odd, because I haven\u2019t been to school for 33 years. How They Broke Britain by James O\u2019Brien is published by Penguin at \u00a320. Buy it for \u00a317 at guardianbookshop.com",

Interviewed in her \u2018Regency mini-mansion\u2019 while her children waited in the billiard room, Dr Miriam Stoppard preached that \u2018happy parents mean happy babies\u2019. She had grown up \u2018quite bereft of mothering\u2019, she said. Her \u2018very poor\u2019 mother worked and she and her sister were \u2018latch-key children\u2019. Although she had written fathers should \u2018be patient if the house is not as tidy as it was\u2019, Tom pulled his weight with their four babies, taking his share of night shifts. \u2018A series of nannies\u2019 also helped. It was \u2018absolute nonsense\u2019 that children might grow up to prefer the help; hers even agreed to take on more chores if the nanny era could be curtailed. \u2018It\u2019s important for children to realise right from the beginning that life isn\u2019t all sweetness and entertainment,\u2019 Stoppard declared briskly. Enjoying retirement in a vast garden full of peacocks and pheasants, Dr Hugh Jolly had offered \u2018a respectable imitation of God\u2019 to a generation of anxious parents. Raised by a full-time nanny, Narna, who joined the family aged 16 and only left at 80, Jolly confessed to seeing little of his three children\u2019s infancy, too, thanks to \u2018a very demanding paediatric consultancy\u2019 (his wife Geraldine\u2019s high-flying gynaecology career took a back seat). Perhaps that influenced his statement: \u2018The really important thing is that parents should enjoy their children\u2019?",

That\u2019s a good thing for the most part, reflecting as it does how many more very good sparkling wines are being made these days in so many different places. Indeed, bubbly, along with the various experimentations being made with leaving white grapes on their skins (aka orange, or skin-contact white wines), is perhaps the single most creative corner of the wine world right now, a far, distant cry from the days, not all that long ago, when it was basically champagne plus a few cheaper, largely inferior alternatives. Like orange wines, much of the novelty in new-wave sparkling wine is actually about reclaiming once-unfashionable or forgotten styles, such as m\u00e9thode ancestrale aka p\u00e9tillant naturel (or pet-nat), where a wine completes its fermentation in bottle, leaving behind plenty of fizz-giving CO2. It\u2019s a style which, in the case of Domaine S\u00e9rol in the C\u00f4te Roannaise east of Lyon, is utterly, joyously juicy and light (10% abv), a rejuvenating tonic for the days between Boxing Day and New Year.Jansz Premium Cuv\u00e9e, Tasmania, Australia NV (\u00a314.49, reduced from \u00a318.99, until 1 January 2024, Waitrose) If the pet-nat/ancestrale method is responsible for some gloriously fun and funky fizz, the traditional method, as patented in Champagne (and also known as the m\u00e9thode champenoise), is still the choice of most ambitious sparkling winemakers, not least in the French region itself, of course. If only The Real Thing will do for your New Year\u2019s Eve toasting, current Champagne favourites of mine include the stylish, patisserie-creamy Tesco Finest Premier Cru Brut Champagne NV (\u00a325), the mouthwatering elegance of Henriot Brut Souverain NV (from \u00a329.97, northandsouthwines.co.uk; thewinesociety.com), the resonant depth and precision of Philipponnat Royale R\u00e9serve Brut NV (\u00a347.21, justerinis.com).

Trentino in Alpine northern Italy is another cool-climate hotspot making increasingly impressive sparkling wines, among them the very pure-fruited Ferrari F1 Edition Brut NV (from \u00a327.97, northandsouthwines.co.uk ; Harvey Nichols). And Germany\u2019s take on bottle-fermented sparkling wine, sekt, is as good as I can remember, with standouts including the tangfastic Dr Loosen Extra Dry Sekt NV (\u00a314.99, down from \u00a318.99 until 1 January 2024).

My mother died a few years earlier, and how she both deteriorated and died was dreadful. I still struggle that I couldn\u2019t help my parents \u2013 whom I loved dearly \u2013 have better deaths. Focusing on my gorgeous children, incredible husband and my work keeps me busy and distracted and, although I believe I am not depressed, I can feel down sometimes. Occasionally, I get struck by sadness attacks, which I fear more than anything. But this isn\u2019t all, my brothers do not talk to each other. I find this very disruptive and emotionally draining. Their relationship has never been good, but they used to be able to be in the same room. However, as soon as my parents died, they terminated their relationship. We no longer celebrate Christmas together, because they make me choose who I want to spend my time with as they have decided not to see each other ever again. I love them both and have made it clear that I will never choose between them. At the same time, I see that they each feel lonely and frustrated, but I cannot help them more than I do. I do not know how to overcome these feelings or why I take responsibility for the whole situation, including the conditions surrounding the death of my parents. How am I wrong? Philippa\u2019s answer You are not wrong about anything. It\u2019s normal for people to carry feelings of guilt or a sense of responsibility for things beyond their control. It is not surprising that your parents\u2019 illnesses and deaths have left you with heightened, charged emotions. And knowing someone you dearly love is dying and not being able to get to them due to the lockdowns is a great regret and sadness for too many. You are carrying that pain, but remember this: your parents are not carrying it. Their pain is no more. And if they were still sentient, which they are not, the last thing they would want would be for you to feel any guilt. They would know that you did your best and did what was possible for you at the time. No one could do more. Grief is love and it sounds like loving people is something you do well. We love someone because of how we feel when we are with them. Your brothers don\u2019t feel great, for whatever reason, when they are with each other, so to avoid those feelings they stay apart. It is hard for you to understand, because you know it is possible to feel good when you are with each of them, but that\u2019s not how they feel together, which is difficult for you to accept. But, again, your parents are spared the pain that you are feeling over their lack of conciliation. It sounds as if your standards and expectations for yourself and others are high. The trouble with high expectations is that they are impossible to meet and easy to fall short of. Lower your expectations about how you and everyone else should feel, be and behave. In fact, if you catch yourself saying \u201cshould\u201d, think, aha! And then drop the \u201cshould\u201d. I think the word \u201cshould\u201d may stop us living full lives. It\u2019s time to change your relationship with your sadness. You dread it, but instead, I want you to welcome it. It shows you loved and cared about your parents. When it descends upon you, know that it is because you can love that you feel it. Profound sorrow and shedding tears play a role in the grieving process. Despite concerns about being unable to stop crying once you start, you need to recognise that the tears will subside. And there\u2019s a possibility of experiencing improvement in wellbeing after they do. It\u2019s difficult to plan crying, it can catch you out, but if it does, don\u2019t apologise, explain it\u2019s because you miss your parents and ask for a hug. You don\u2019t have to be the one who is responsible for everyone, sometimes they need to look after you, too. Christmas tends to over-stress whatever situation we are in and so it is natural that you should be dreading it. When it comes to your brothers, forget trying to give them a decent Christmas, see them at a different time when the seasonal magnifying glass isn\u2019t there. When something feels too much, don\u2019t take it on. It is natural for us to focus on what doesn\u2019t feel right, we are hardwired to look for danger and conflict, because that\u2019s how humans have managed to survive. Nevertheless, you can practise switching your focus away from your brothers, away from the pain your parents suffered (but suffer no more) and switch it to your own family. You are the new matriarch. Continue to love your kids and husband and see what you\u2019ve made and what you have. Don\u2019t let anyone make you feel guilty. It\u2019s natural you regret what your parents went through and now it is time to remember the good times you had with them. Sadness is OK, you are allowed to be sad. It\u2019s when we don\u2019t allow ourselves to feel sad that we put ourselves in danger of depression.

        "content": "For the most part, it is the kids that have it all at Christmas \u2013 the Advent calendar, a trip to see Santa, a stocking full of gifts. But what about us, the adults \u2013 do we grow out of the magic? When I was in early high school, I sang carols at the local hospital on Christmas Eve \u2013 an annual tradition we had stuck with for a few years. One year when it finished, I realised for the first time that the sleepless childlike excitement I usually had for Christmas wasn\u2019t building like it used to. I felt sad and confused. By the next morning, with presents and chocolate for breakfast, that sadness had dissipated but in hindsight it was probably the moment when the dial shifted, when a small departure from childhood occurred. At the time I feared I had lost the warm fuzzy feeling of Christmas forever. But now, over a decade later, the joy I feel at the magic of Christmas persists, just in a different way. As a kid, Christmas is, for the most part, all about Santa. The milk he will drink as he passes through, the reindeer that dash overhead, the letters received at the north pole. While the make-believe magic may leave us when the secret is broken , it is only one part of the season. Christmas for adults is about that same magic, but much of it is about tradition . Christmas isn\u2019t Christmas until I\u2019ve put up the tree with my family. Unboxing the decorations is all about the memories they hold. There are the ones I wasn\u2019t allowed to hang because they were too heavy and the branches might snap, or those I made out of paper at school and brought home. There are the decorated eggshells we carried all the way back from Austria, and the fish with big glittery lips that I\u2019m sure is one of a kind. In our family, a rocky road tree from an old Women\u2019s Weekly cookbook is the centrepiece of the table. It is so much of a tradition, it is almost known as our recipe. Family food brings us joy \u2013 and those recipes so often come out at Christmas time. My grandmother makes mince pies with hand-rolled pastry \u2013 one of secrets is baking the pies from frozen \u2013 which she taught me from start to finish a few years ago. I\u2019m yet to make a full batch again myself, so onerous is the prep involved. There is always an afternoon walk, always a movie on Boxing Day, always a real pine tree. For adults, perhaps it is less about Christmas Day and more about soaking up the season unfolding around us. Wreaths go on doors, fairy lights are strung up wherever they will fit. In Europe, snow falls and night markets buzz, giving you an excuse to eat apple strudel and gl\u00fchwein for dinner. Enjoying the decorations in the shops, and maybe having a candy cane \u2013 it is that feeling that infects us with a childlike joy. It is true \u2013 many of us bemoan Christmas songs that start too early in shopping centres, the mounting list of presents to buy or the decorations that go up the day after Halloween. Not all Christmas trees are as magnificent as the one at the Rockefeller Center , but there is nothing like the glow of a tree in your house, or in a shop window as you pass. Full disclaimer: I am not a parent. Filling the Advent calendar , finding the Christmas crackers that don\u2019t cost a fortune but have good jokes or hosting the day, can make the lead up stressful. But somewhere, doing all these things does suck you into the magic, until you find yourself singing along to Mariah Carey or unable to turn off the crappy Christmas movie on TV. Christmas can be hard and isolating for some. Families coming together can clash, and in the last three years, too many have spent Christmas alone. This year, we have conflicts raging on around the globe as we celebrate \u2013 pause for thought when you get to hug your loved ones on the day. High-school me thought that maybe without elves and reindeer, Christmas may never be magical. But even if the fantasy is one step removed, I love the season. You only have to see it to believe it.",

We just want people who are fanatical about music.\u201d They were auditioning for a new host for the music TV channel, Channel V on Foxtel, holding auditions at every major city, and what I\u2019d understood from reading blogs about it was that you had to be there really early. So I showed up at 5:30am and it was icy cold, one of those Melbourne mornings. \u2018Boat person, ladyboy or drug dealer\u2019: how Australian TV sidelines Asians Read more There were about 20 people already in the queue before me, so I was happy. I thought: \u201cAlright, I\u2019ve turned up at the right time.\u201d We had to stand there in the queue for a good couple of hours before the door opened and more and more people were accumulating behind me. I was listening to these people and they were name-dropping, and they were really cool and they were wearing great clothes and they were there with groups of friends. The voice in my head telling me to to go home was so strong. It was like, this is so undignified to be wanting something and trying to get it. But I stayed. At the time I was working as a chef in the snow. I got the call-up saying, \u201cHey, you\u2019re one of the finalists for Channel V, can you come to Sydney?\u201d And I was like, \u201cI have a job, you know, I have a life. Can I come to Sydney? Yeah, I can come to Sydney. Sure!\u201d It was a week away. It involved spending about seven days making content for this channel \u2013 a bunch of cool stuff to do over a week. They said we\u2019re pretty sure the person you\u2019ll be interviewing for your live interview will be Robbie Williams . And I remember it was snowing and I was alone looking at all these happy people in parkas and goggles and woolly beanies and thinking, \u201cOh, Robbie Williams, he\u2019s kind of a big deal.\u201d I thought if I really am going to interview Robbie Williams, what would I ask him? I really thought if I wanted to represent women like me, I\u2019d ask him if I could kiss him. \u201cI don\u2019t really care about your singing. But I think you\u2019re hot.\u201d We started working on a Monday and my interview was on Thursday. So these eight finalists who were all vying for this one job at Channel V came to the point where we all split off and did different things. He grabbed me and did a ballroom dancing dip and planted a big, fat, wet, open-mouth kiss on my mouth I got to this moment where I knew I was going to be interviewing Robbie Williams and we were backstage in the green room. Osher G\u00fcnsberg was there, one producer in a headset, Robbie and his manager. It was pretty calm backstage. So I had an opportunity to say, \u201cRobbie, is it all right if I pash you?\u201d And he goes \u201cPash?\u201d and he turns to his manager: \u201cPash. What\u2019s pashing?\u201d And the manager goes, \u201cPashing, it\u2019s the same as snogging.\u201d Robbie goes, \u201cOh snogging, oh yeah. OK. I better have a mint then.\u201d For some reason, we were all dressed up as Hugh Hefner. Look, it\u2019s the year 2000, and I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s live TV, Foxtel, but I was wearing a silk smoking jacket. Osher was too, and they dressed Robbie in one as well. So we all looked ridiculous. I forgot what the joke was, but I was out on set with Osher. We called action and the cameras started rolling. And before I had a chance to ask him anything, Robbie said: \u201cSo we\u2019re going to snog, then?\u201d He grabbed me and did a ballroom dancing dip and planted a big, fat, wet, open-mouth kiss on my mouth. Everybody started screaming and it was chaos. Back at the Foxtel office, the other seven contestants were watching the TV as it broadcast live, and they all went: \u201cFuck, Yumi\u2019s got the job.\u201d The interview continued, but I was still breathless and trying to maintain my composure. You can see it if you look it up on YouTube . I\u2019m fanning myself and trying to cool off because he was a really good kisser. He wasn\u2019t being half-arsed about it. Then we were about to throw to a break, and he grabbed me and kissed me again. And I was like, this is like the happiest day of my life. I have nailed this job. I\u2019ve fulfilled the brief. People are going to be talking about this for years to come. Within a couple of months, my whole life had changed. I never cheffed again. Telling this story feels really good. I thought I\u2019d get sick of talking about it, but I\u2019m kind of in celebration of it and it just makes me laugh now. But on video it looks very nonconsensual because he grabs me and kisses me. I\u2019m impressed that I knew to ask for consent for a kiss in a safe and calm way, in a safe, calm space, and to listen for his answer and for him to give his consent, and for me to understand also that I could withdraw my consent. I have met Robbie Williams a couple of times since then. He doesn\u2019t remember. It\u2019s been 23 years, but that\u2019s the story that everybody wants to hear. They also want to know if anything happened between us after that. Robbie is very authentic. I think in the persona you see on camera and off, it\u2019s the same person. And he made it pretty politely clear that I wasn\u2019t his type. In the nicest possible way.",

        "content": "T here aren\u2019t many people who would see potential in a sprawling industrial warehouse filled with water pipes and various other industrial paraphernalia mere metres from the Adriatic coastline. But interior designer Eva Germani has a vivid imagination and, she says, \u201can innate attraction for imperfection\u201d. The 50-year-old designer came across the cavernous property one day in 2019, while walking in the seaside town of Riccione where she grew up. \u201cI found myself disarmed in front of an uninteresting space,\u201d she explains. \u201cSince I was a child, I dreamed of living in decadent or poetic historic buildings.\u201d The one standing before her had \u201cno history and this area is not known for buildings of architectural or historical value\u201d but she was undeterred. The warehouse is situated on the lesser known, but increasingly popular, Romagnola Riviera. When the blistering temperatures that attract tourists from all over the world subside in September, this tourist enclave turns into a tranquil corner of Italy. \u201cLiving near the sea gives you the great privilege of always feeling a bit on vacation, like a tourist and that\u2019s a feeling I really like,\u201d says Germani. Curtain call: drapes and chandeliers in the dining room. Photograph: Living Inside/Fabrizio Cicconi Faced with a blank canvas, she and her children, Francesca, 27, and Davide, 19, set about a six-month restoration to turn the container into an open-plan, home-cum-design studio and they turned their attentions to filling it with her personality and plenty of colour. . Francesca praises her mother\u2019s pursuit of beauty in the least expected of settings: \u201cFor me it\u2019s completely normal to grow up surrounded by very big concepts and artistic curations,\u201d she says. \u201cBeauty as a concept is often missing in the reality of the real world.\u201d In a stroke of serendipity, permission to turn the building from a commercial premises into a residential dwelling had already been granted, avoiding the lengthy \u2013 and often bureaucratic \u2013 application process to do so. All the planning thereafter was straightforward, says Germani. Classic touches: antique furniture and sumptuous fabrics. Photograph: Living Inside/Fabrizio Cicconi \u201cIt was a very flexible and open space and so offered the chance to be interpreted in a flexible way \u2013 that\u2019s why I chose it,\u201d says Germani. Reclaimed Italian door frames have been drafted in to form entrances and facades of cupboards and storage areas; chandeliers \u2013 reworked with recycled crystals and coloured resins by Petralux \u2013 descend from the ceilings to shed light and imbue a sense of grandeur. Meanwhile, in a stroke of genius, the dividing walls are actually not walls at all, but panels hooked to iron bars that hang from the ceiling. \u201cIt allows us to completely change the space with the greatest of ease,\u201d says Germani. \u201cEach \u2018room\u2019 can expand and shrink, changing their purpose in moments.\u201d Case in point, she laughs, the area that they call the dining room was transformed the previous week with a large flock of birds that Francesca, a scenographer and costume designer, was making for her latest movie. The only defined spaces are the luxurious bathroom, complete with an antique roll-top bath (surrounded by Germani\u2019s handpainted curtains) and the kitchen, furnished with vintage units, from where the family cook up pasta and locally caught fish. The walls are collaged with lavish handpainted artwork, draped materials and wall coverings that Germani has designed. The huge tiger with a halo is from a prototype for the Wonder wallpaper she designed for Wall & Dec\u00f2 ; the portrait of a woman is a painting in tempura and natural pigments on scenography paper taken from a photographic work by Vivienne Bellini; and the dreamy florals riff on her Niveum graphic that won a 2019 German Design Award. Germani\u2019s approach to furniture is akin to \u201cfalling in love\u201d, she says. \u201cI think I\u2019m very nostalgic, it moves me to see objects of the past.\u201d Many of the pieces that are here have been collected for years, from prototypes, such as the Renzo Serafini lamps to one-of-a-kind treasures from flea markets. She has also collected trophy pieces, such as the metal coffee tables sourced from her friend Francesca Orsi of L\u2019Orangerie. It\u2019s an interchangeable, constantly morphing space. The door frames propped up against the walls are frequently whipped out to be used in a shoot or on a set. \u201cThey are all a part of my life and also my work,\u201d she says. It\u2019s a home that is, without question, a living, breathing portfolio of the family\u2019s inventive spirit. \u201cIt\u2019s not refined like a home and it\u2019s still a work in progress, but we don\u2019t feel the need to define every corner and detail.\u201d Perfect imperfection like this is rarely defined \u2013 and is all the better for it.",
